<p>Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 28th June 1961</p>
<p>A person doesn’t know the truth is only turning towards dukkha. Men are searching for women and women are searching for men. They are searching for the wrong thing. The real searching is for the truth. The truth still exists in the world but people are searching for dāna, sīla and samatha practices.</p>
<p>(Sayadaw gave the simile of a blind turtle in the ocean for the rarity of getting the human existence. After that, he continued to talk about the Bodhisatta’s two former teachers, Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta. They were arūpajhāna attainers but did not have the chance for enlightenment. Sayadaw wanted to emphasize the difficulty of having the opportunity to practice the truth).</p>
<p>These examples are describing your power of the good kamma. And therefore do not be lazy. Even the Bodhisatta without knowing the truth sometimes born as animals (For example, Bhuridatta, the Serpent King or King of Nāga). This point is very important. Any being without destroying the seed of the identity view — sakkāya diṭṭhi can be fallen into the four planes of misery in the round of existence.</p>
<p>Even the real Bodhisattas were no exception and no need to say about the unreal ones. There were 550 Jataka Stories of the Buddha’s past lives as Bodhisatta, and he was born as animals for many times. In one life as the prince Temiya, even had mentioned once in hell before (also Temiya; J. vi, 3, the Mūgapakkha Jātaka).</p>
<p>But there are some misconceptions about Bodhisattas always living in Heaven and other things). In the world there is no greater fault than not knowing the truth. (Sayadaw explained the three knowledges as mentioned in the First Discourse of the Buddha.</p>
<p>These are; Sacca Ñāṇa, Kicca Ñāṇa and Kata Ñāṇa. May be these are able to be translated as theoretical knowledge, practical knowledge and resultant knowledge). Sacca Ñāṇa is the lower knowledge. Kicca Ñāṇa is the middle knowledge. Kata Ñāṇa is the higher knowledge. Listening to what I am saying and paying attention to the khandha.</p>
<p>Whatever arising in the khandha and knowing as dukkha sacca is Sacca Ñāṇa (Exception of lobha). It’s not including anicca yet. At the moment of arising and knowing is Sacca Ñāṇa. Wanting something or wanting to do something is Samudaya Sacca (only lobha). Samudaya ceases is Nirodha Sacca.</p>
<p>To know whatever arising is Magga Sacca. All these are ordinary knowing. This is with the help of a teacher. These are the way of knowing in details (Not a combined knowing).</p>
<p>Every time dhamma arises in the khandha by knowing these four points with the analytical knowledge is Sacca Ñāṇa. Even this lower knowledge is not everyone knowing it. Knowing these things is coming from the help of a teacher’s explanation. Even Ālara Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmputta didn’t know this knowledge.</p>
<p>This way of knowing was listening to the dhamma by the group of five monks. (Pañca-vaggiya bhikkus, the first five disciples of the Buddha). How can someone knows the arising dhamma if he never heard about these dhammas? Every time with the truth of arising and knowing of it is Sacca Ñāṇa. Kicca Ñāṇa — whatever arises in the khandha is rising and passing away. Knowing thoroughly as impermanence is dukkha sacca.</p>
<p>Knowing thoroughly as it is dukkha arising and dukkha vanishing. This is fully understanding of dukkha sacca (pariññāya). There is nothing existing except of Dukkha Sacca. Kicca is one thing and Ñāṇa is another thing (The object is kicca and contemplative mind is ñāṇa). Kicca Ñāṇa is the practice (contemplation). You'll become a disadvantaged person if you don’t have this knowledge. Penetrative knowing is knowing thoroughly. Sacca Ñāṇa is ordinary knowing. Contemplation is doing the Kicca Ñāṇa. What I am worrying about you is Ñāṇa not turning towards the Khandha’s Kicca (Function of the Khandha). Khandha is always telling us its function. Ñāṇa not turning towards it that cannot get the Kicca Ñāṇa.</p>
