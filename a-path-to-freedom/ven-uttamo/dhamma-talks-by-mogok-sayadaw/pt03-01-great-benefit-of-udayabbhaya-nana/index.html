<p>Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 3rd March 1959</p>
<p>Except the Buddha and Pacceka-buddha, no one can enlighten without listening to talks. In the Majjhima Nikāya, Māgandiya Sutta, the Buddha mentioned that anyone who completed with these 3-factors can realize Nibbāna in this life. [The 3-factors are: (1) Association with men of integrity (2) Hear the true Dhamma (3) Practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma]. The Buddha always only said the true words. Therefore, don't doubt about it, also don't doubt in yourself. Only fulfill the No. (3) factor ~ practice in accordance with the Dhamma is easy. If the mind and body tell you impermanence, just know it. You will realize the Dhamma (i.e., discerning anicca) in this life if impermanence and the ñāṇa knowing become together. I will take the responsibility for you. If you discern impermanence, no need to pray for Nibbāna and continue to know this, then you will arrive there by itself. If you know impermanence, you get the knowledge of as it really is (yathābhūta Ñāṇa). And then continue to know it will arrive to the knowledge of disenchantment. Still continuing to know it and arriving at the end of it, which is The Path Knowledge. If you can discern anicca, you are the 3-rooted person (Tihetuka: a person born with 3-wholesome roots, non-greed, non-hatred and non-delusion), other types of persons can't discern it. You should have these three knowledges in order to arrive at Nibbāna. If you are still practicing and have not gotten the Path Knowledge yet, why is this? Your practice is still not in accordance with the Dhamma because impermanence and the knowing are not fit together. Practice in accordance with the Dhamma is ending the round of existences (saṁsāra). Because by seeing anicca, ignorance won’t come in, saṅkhāra and viññāṇa won’t arise, and the new khandha not arises. (see the 12-links of D. A.)</p>
<p>Then, a question need to ask; “How long I have to practice? Do I need to practice for my whole life?” After you discern anicca and become gladdening, then it's not far from Nibbāna. After that, follow by disenchantment of anicca. All these were mentioned by the Buddha. (e.g., in The Dhammapada) Joy, gooseflesh, happiness, light etc., any one of them will arise (i.e., the 10-insight corruptions). After that, not very long, the knowledge of disenchantment will come. This is Nibbidā Ñāṇa. If you arrive to the level of 10-insight corruptions, impermanence is succeeded. When you arrive to this point, don't get up and go away. After that, you will not see the arising of phenomena but only the passing away of them. And then, later you will see the disenchantment of passing away.</p>
<p>[Here in this talk, Sayadaw warned the yogis not to get up and go away when impermanence is succeeded. In some of his talks, he also warned the yogis when they arrived at the knowledge of disenchantment, not to get up and go away for whatever reasons; but stick to the practice until Nibbāna was realized.]</p>
