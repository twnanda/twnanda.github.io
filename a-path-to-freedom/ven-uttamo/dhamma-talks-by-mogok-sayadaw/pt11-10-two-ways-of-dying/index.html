<p>Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 29th August 1962</p>
<p>Listening to dhamma talks is for the freedom of death (This was true for Sayadaw and his disciples. Is it true for all Buddhists? Some Buddhists expounded new ideas and philosophy for the becoming – bhava – taṇhā). During the listening of talk, we are moving towards death.</p>
<p>I’ll teach you the way of dying. (Told the story of Ven. Phugguna, the sick monk at near death) Khandha accepts everything which you all fear of. Therefore, it becomes worsening if you’re staying longer with it. All dukkha are accumulated with it. Someone not knowing the truth is a crazy and blind person.</p>
<p>Do you still have desire for this useless khandha? (Sayadaw mentioned some problems of the khandha.) It’s not beneficial to look after the khandha. It’s only moving towards ageing, sickness and death. It is dukkha sacca to collect wealth and other things for this khandha without any benefit. But it’s never arising to our mind as enough is enough.</p>
<p>Ven. Phugguna died as an anāgāmin (non-returner). His eye, etc., bodily faculties were clear and bright and looked like an alive person. There are two ways of dying; → ① Die with listening to talks ② Contemplation on one’s khandha and die. You have to listen to the kind of dhamma talks to understand dukkha sacca.</p>
<p>(This is very important point to keep in mind because Ven. Sāriputta gave a talk to his friend, the brahman who was dying with samatha and reborn as a Brahma god. Later he had to go there again and gave another talk on truth (sacca dhamma). He also gave sacca dhamma to Anāthapiṇḍika at his death bed. It should be this kind of talks).</p>
<p>If the dying person had time and listened to the Buddha’s talk or one of the disciples’ talk (Here Ven. Phugguna listened to the Buddha’s talk) If you don’t have time for these and contemplate by yourself near death. Painful feeling will usually arise at near death dukkha. Contemplate it as impermanent, oppressive, dukkha sacca khandha and follow with maggan.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is dying with magga in this way. Someone in pain is the nature of dukkha vedanā. With the arising and vanishing that vedanā disappears. Vedanā is anicca and contemplative mind is anicca ñāṇa. It’s not easy to listen to talk near death. You have to look for a person to give talk.</p>
<p>Also he must be a person can give sacca dhamma. (Nowadays is easy because we can access recorded tapes on Dhamma. Some of Mogok Sayadaw’s close disciples were dying by listening to his recorded tapes. In Sayadaw’s Biography, once time he mentioned to a disciple the benefit of recorded tapes and recorder.</p>
<p>If we can use it properly even it can send us to Nibbāna, and blissful births. Using it wrongly send us to hells, animals and ghosts realms. Nowadays media are choosing the second way. Doors to hells, animals and ghost realms are opening to most of us).</p>
<p>Therefore the best way of dying is with one’s own contemplation or practice. King Milinda asked; “Can All attain Nibbāna?” The answer was not all.</p>
<p>The one who can attain Nibbāna is:</p>
<p>① What should have to be known with penetration must penetrate it. What should have to know with analysis has to analyze.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">② What should have to abandon has to abandon.</div>
<div class="line">③ What should must realize has to realize.</div>
<div class="line">④ What should have to develope has to develope.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>(All these are about the Noble Truths). One who knows the truths will attain Nibbāna. [This is no. ① point].</p>
<p>There only is zero left if you don’t even try one of them. And then I myself can’t help you. If you try one dukkha sacca, all are included. (This was from Saccasaṁyutta) The maggan analyze it as dukkha sacca. So it includes magga sacca. Magga arises and samudaya ceases. Khadhanirodho nibbānaṁ – the cessation of khandha is Nibbāna. And nirodha sacca appears.</p>
