<p>Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 21st June 1962</p>
<p>[Sayadaw explained the two knowledges of the truth in the practice; i.e., anubodha ñāṇa and pativedha ñāṇa. The differences between them are:</p>
<p>With the help of a teacher know how to practice, seeing anicca and knowing dukkha is anubodha ñāṇa or vipassanā ñāṇa (not including of penetration).</p>
<p>The other is penetration of dukkha and realization of Nibbāna or the path knowledge (knowing with penetration). These are two knowledges of knowing the truth. Without the anubodha ñāṇa and pativedha ñāṇa will not arise. The other differences between them are far away from kilesa and abandoning of kilesa.</p>
<p>Another point is kilesa not drying out yet and so the path knowledge not arises. Insight knowledges are drying out the kilesas and path knowledge totally burns them off. At the stage of anubodha ñāṇa is seeing the impermanence of any one of the khandhas. At the time of pativedha ñāṇa arises and you can make the decision that whatever arises is the real dukkha and then path knowledge arises. ]</p>
<p>There are two knowledges of knowing the truth; anubodha ñāṇa and pativedha ñāṇa. Impermanence was the truth of dukkha, which was taught by teachers. Taking a system of practice from a teacher, with contemplation and knowing by oneself is anubodha ñāṇa.</p>
<p>This is not yet penetrative knowing. This is known by following the knowledge of the Buddha and teachers. It is impermanent here and there in the whole body. Nibbāna has not yet arisen since Dukkha do not cease. These are only insight knowledges. It is not yet the penetrative knowledge by oneself and dukkha not ceases. Only by contemplating a lot, you will have the penetrative knowledge. It becomes mature and knowing it as real dukkha sacca.</p>
<p>And then it supports pativedha ñāṇa. So, these are vipassanā ñāṇa and magga ñāṇa. Knowing with what the teacher has said and with penetration by oneself. Nibbāna can’t be known by what the teacher has said to you. The differences between them are far away from the kilesas and its disappearance.</p>
<p>Knowing thoroughly with the Path Knowledge can dispel kilesas and it will never come back again. You can get Nibbāna only by making kilesas far away. Why can’t I get Nibbāna yet? Because kilesas have not dried out yet. After kilesas dry out, and burn with the path knowledge and then it disappears. This was a simile given by the Buddha.</p>
<p>Let’s look for the truth in the khandha. From the head down to the feet, you will find the different changing nature in the khandha. Select one of them for the contemplation. If you prefer feeling and contemplate feeling, prefer mind and mind, prefer form and form, etc.</p>
<p>In the khandha always exist with impermanent dukkha sacca. And it will show you that all. Only with the penetration of knowledge the matter will finish. Khandha is only dukkha sacca and should never doubt about that. This was coming from the first discourse of the Buddha. At first know as feeling, mind, etc.; after that not as feeling and mind but know as real dukkha sacca.</p>
<p>The khandha is truth of dukkha. So, only truth of dukkha arises. Know the mind, feeling as impermanence with anubodha ñāṇa. When the pativedha ñāṇa arises, it’s not khandha but can decide as real suffering. Therefore, outside the Buddha Sāsana, Sacca Dhamma disappeared and couldn’t become Buddha and arahants.</p>
<p>So don’t condemn on your perfection (pāramīs). Instead just work hard to develop these two ñāṇa (anubodha and pativedha ñāṇas).</p>
