<p>Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 10th October 1961</p>
<p>Vipassanā exists only in the Buddha-sāsana, we also encounter it. You'll also meet a good teacher that continues to practise hard. It’s sure to make the achievement. Don’t believe in what other people say that perfection (pāramīs) has to be fulfilled slowly. Don’t believe in them. The Buddha also gave us the guarantee for the realization within seven years, seven months, and seven days (in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta). Phongyi (Sayadaw) also wants to remind you that within this short period don’t waste your time and energy for the matters of family and business. This period can stop the dangers of ageing, sickness and death and not falling down to the dangers of apāyas. I am worrying that you will run out of time with no practice. It’s very sad to spoil it. The Buddha warning us the important of practice and knowledge (ñāṇa) have to fit together. A dhamma is arising and contemplate it quickly with ñāṇa. According to the Buddha if you don’t separate anicca and ñāṇa could finish it seven days. If your prayers (perfections) are fulfilled by practising in the morning you will achieve it in the evening. In this case why don't we realise it? Because anicca and magga are not fitting together. For this matter the Buddha taught the Telapatta Sutta (Bowl of Oil Discourse, Satipaṭṭhāna Saṃyutta) [SN.47.20 Janapadakalyāṇīsuttaṃ, At Sedaka (The Beauty Queen) Sedaka Sutta] for us.</p>
<p>(Sayadaw using his teaching of cittānupassanā to explain this sutta)</p>
<p>Thirteen kinds of mind is like a bowl of oil. You must contemplate anicca whatever arises from the six senses of the door. don’t let your mind go out anywhere. If it’s going outside or to the objects of five sensual pleasure and taṇhā (craving), upādāna (clinging) and kamma (action) will kill you. It’s very bad indeed if the mind goes out. If you contemplate feelings, then three kinds of feeling is the bowl of oil. Is there any kilesa leaking hole if anicca and magga are not separated? You’ll encounter ageing, sickness and death if you going outside of satipaṭṭhāna. It’s a victory if you don't go out. This point is very important. The oil not spilled from the bowl is D.A. process does not continue. It doesn’t mean at other times, only at the time of insight practice.</p>
<p>In the beginning of sitting practice simply breathe in and breathe out. You have to know the breath coming in and coming out. If a mind is arising and follows behind it. Following back the breathing in mind and breathing out mind if nothing is arising. Contemplation of feeling also in the same way. The bowl of oil is like the contemplating objects, the contemplative knowledge (ñāṇa) is the criminal and the executioner is the D.A. process. Have to practise it for a long time? It doesn’t have to. You have to pass through these two places (i.e., a bar place with many alcoholics and a place with a beautiful dancer with many people). You have to pass through the knowledge of rise and fall and the knowledge of disenchantment (rise and fall represent a bar; disenchantment to the dancing place). After you pass through it and arrive at the place of the path (magga).</p>
<p>[Note: In the original sutta not mentioned a bar with alcoholics. It was Sayadaw’s invention. Here we know Sayadawji’s creative wisdom. A bar with alcoholics also can represent avijjā and delusion— not knowing phenomena as is really it (anicca, dukkha, anatta). The beautiful dancer can represent taṇhā and passing through is disenchantment and not wanting it. Taṇhā dies is the path (magga).]</p>
<p>If the mind is moving towards other objects and you have to contemplate their objects of anicca. This is making adjustment to the bowl of oil when it becomes slightly tilted. This is from Saṃyutta Nikāya (the above sutta). I also have to talk about it from Aṅguttara Nikāya. During the contemplation of anicca, don’t let kilesas come in between them (i.e., between anicca and the mind). During the time of disenchanted also don’t let kilesas come in. The main point in the two suttas is the same-i.e., not let the oil spill and not let kilesas come in. At the time of sitting, making the determination (adhiṭṭhāna) of within 15 minutes or half an hour I will not let kilesas come in. After that, increase the time span of sitting little by little. (This is wise advice for beginners).</p>
