<p><strong>The Chart of Dependent Arising Process (D.A. Process)</strong></p>
<p>Here onwards will use the short form D.A. for the Dependent Arising Process. Mogok Sayadaw's talks were based on the D.A. process.</p>
<p>For this purpose he constructed a chart which is called the circular chart of the D.A. process. This chart was based on the suttas and commentaries. Therefore to understand more clearer on his talks have to understand this chart. He wrote some verses and explained the teaching systematically (Note: Paṭicca-samuppāda is translated in different ways: 1. Dependent Co-origination; 2. Dependent Arising; 3. Dependent Origination).</p>
<p>The verses on the chart of D.A. process</p>
<p>First verse: Two roots (mūla), 2 truths, 4 groups of layers and 12 factors with its meanings. Three connections, again 2 roots, 3 rounds for existence (vaṭṭas), 3 periods of time, 20 factors of causes and effects, and have to study these 8 points by heart and realize it with practice. This is the liberation from saṁsāra.</p>
<p>Second verse: Base on ignorance (avijjā) and craving (taṇhā), clinging (upādāna), action (kamma) and mind-body arise. Like a tree from a seed, and a seed from a tree, which are connecting without break. With the cause of kamma and mind-body; and with mind-body and kamma arises. In this way these are arising again and again. Contemplating with knowledge as many humans, gods and living beings appear are not by the Mahā Brahma's or God's Creation.</p>
<p>First it needs to learn the 8 points, just mentioned in the first verse, and then to study the 12 factors of D.A. process. By itself it can be a long lecture for many hours. Here only give a short introduction for it. After having the basic ideas on it and we can contemplate to find out more by ourselves. The Buddha's Teachings are always practical and developing wisdom faculty. Faith without wisdom is blind faith and leading to sufferings.</p>
<p>Study of the 8 points</p>
<p>D.A. process is the khandha process. Paṭiccasamuppāda, khandhas and saṁsāra are the same thing.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Two roots: Ignorance and craving, these are the beginning of the 12 links of the D.A. process. It doesn't mean that it is the first cause. These also have their causes. These are the roots of saṁsāra (rounds of existence), or the root causes of the khandhas. Written in the middle of the circle is like a wheel axle in bold letters as avijjā and taṇhā. They are turning the samsāric wheel on and on non-stop.</li>
<li>Two truths: It was written in the 1st section bottom layer as samudaya sacca, in the 2nd section as dukkha sacca, and then in the 3rd and 4th section as samudaya and dukkha. saccas respectively. Combine the same together and become 2 truths; i.e., samudaya and dukkha saccas.</li>
<li>Four groups of layer: In section ①, it's the layer of the past causes. In sec. ②, it's the layer of the present results. In sec. ③, it is the layer of the present causes. In sec. ④, it is the layer of future results. All these are only in different periods of time. With combination become 2 layers of the causes and 2 layers of the results. Sec. ③ also can be written as the layer of the future causes.</li>
</ol>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">4. Twelve factors:</div>
<div class="line">Section ① includes avijjā and saṅkhāra—(ignorance and volitional formation).</div>
<div class="line">Section ② includes viññāṇa, nāma-rūpa, saḷāyatana, phassa, and vedanā (consciousness, mind-matter, 6 sense-bases, contact, feeling)</div>
<div class="line">Section ③ includes taṇhā, upādāna and kammabhava (craving, clinging, existence)</div>
<div class="line">Section ④ includes jāti, jara, maraṇa (birth, ageing, death)</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>There is an arrow from the top of the circle running through to the bottom and separated the circle into two halves. On the right hand side half are the 7 factors of avijjā, saṅkhāra, viññāṇa……. vedanā. These are leading by the past root of avijjā. On the left hand side half are the 5 factors of taṇhā, upādāna, kammabhava, jāti, jara-maraṇa.</p>
<p>These are leading by the present root of taṇhā. Leading by the past root of avijjā are 7 factors and leading by the present root of taṇhā are 5 factors. And totally all are 12 factors. These 12 factors with its meanings will be discussed later.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">5. The three connections:</div>
<div class="line">① The first connection; sec. ① saṅkhāra with sec. ② viññāṇa.</div>
<div class="line">② The 2nd connection; sec. ② vedanā with sec. ③ taṇhā.</div>
<div class="line">③ The 3rd connection; sec. ③ kammabhava with sec. ④ jāti.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">As the causes and effects connections;</div>
<div class="line">① The past 5 causes connect with the present 5 results. (i.e., avijjā ….. bhava viññāṇa … vedanā)</div>
<div class="line">② The present 5 results connect with the present 5 causes. (i.e., viññāṇa…. vedanā taṇhā…. saṅkhāra)</div>
<div class="line">③ The present 5 causes connect with the future results. (i.e., taṇhā… saṅkhāra viññāṇa…. vedanā)</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">As layers connections;</div>
<div class="line">(1) The past cause layer connects with the present result layer.</div>
<div class="line">(2) The present result layer connects with the present cause layer.</div>
<div class="line">(3) The present cause layer connects with the future result layer.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">As truth connections;</div>
<div class="line">(1) Samudaya sacca and dukkha sacca connection (i.e., sec ① to sec ②)</div>
<div class="line">(2) Dukkha sacca to samudaya sacca connection (i.e., sec ② to sec. ③)</div>
<div class="line">(3) Samudaya sacca to dukkha sacca connection (i.e., sec ③ to sec. ④)</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">6. Three rounds of existence (3 vaṭṭas):</div>
<div class="line">The three rounds show the cyclic pattern of existence in Saṁsāra. Written at sec. ① are kilesa vaṭṭa and kamma vaṭṭa. At sec ④ is vipāka vaṭṭa. Kilesa means it makes beings become tired, defiled and suffered. Also it is burning beings like fire and destroying wholesome dhammas.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Vaṭṭa means round of event, moving round in a circle or round of existence. Therefore kilesa vaṭṭa means oppressive dhamma which afflict or torment beings with tiredness and suffering in a circle. In see ① and sec ③ kilesa vaṭṭas are indicating by arrow as avijjā, taṇhā and upādāna.</p>
<p>Kamma vaṭṭa means actions are going on in a cycle. In sec ① and sec ③ the 2 kamma vaṭṭas are indicating by arrow as saṅkhāra and kamma bhava.</p>
<p>Vipāka vaṭṭa means results are going on in a circle. In sec ④ the 8 vipāka vaṭṭas are indicating by arrow as viññāṇa … vedanā, jāti, upapattibhava, jara–maraṇa. In some places not including upapattibhava and mentioned 7 vipāka vaṭṭas only. upapattibhava means khandhas arise or cause by kamma. It seemed to be kammabhava and upapattibhava both related to the Abhidhamma. A Burmese teacher said that jāti must take kammabhava.</p>
<p>Kilesa vaṭṭa and kamma vaṭṭa are the causes for round of existence. And vipāka—is the result of the round of existence. The most fundamental round is the round of defilements (kilesa vaṭṭa).</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">7. Three periods of time:</div>
<div class="line">Section ① is past life. Section ② and ③ are present life. And section ④ is the future life.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">8. Twenty factors of causes and effects:</div>
<div class="line">① Sec. ① has the 5 past causes. These are avijjā, saṅkhāra, taṇhā, upādāna and bhava.</div>
<div class="line">② Sec. ② has the 5 present results. These are viññāṇa…. vedanā.</div>
<div class="line">③ Sec. ③ has the 5 present causes. These are taṇhā, upādāna, bhava, avijjā, saṅkhāra</div>
<div class="line">④ Sec. ④ has the 5 future results. These are viññāṇa…. vedanā. Therefore all together are 20 factors of causes and effects.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Have to study these eight points:</div>
<div class="line">① 2 roots ② 2 truths ③ 4 groups of layers ④ 12 factors ⑤ 3 connections ⑥ 3 rounds of existence ⑦ 3 periods of time ⑧20 factors of cause and effect</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Learn by heart:</div>
<div class="line">Study the D. A. process with its chart is called pariyatti—learning/studying. Learn it by heart and can use it any time in need.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">To realize it:</div>
<div class="line">To understand them with practice is called patipatti—direct knowledge.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">This is the liberation from saṁsāra:</div>
<div class="line">It's called pativeda—realization of Nibbāna, the ending of dukkha. All these 3 stages are also can be described as follow.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">With full understanding—pariññā:</div>
<div class="line">Learn by heart is ñāta pariññā—full understanding by study.</div>
<div class="line">Practise is tīraṇa pariññā full understanding by contemplation.</div>
<div class="line">Pahāna pariññā—full understanding with abandoning of kilesa.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">With truths (sacca):</div>
<div class="line">Learn by heart is sacca nyan (ñāṇa)—knowledge of truth comes by listening talks. Kicca ñāṇa—functional knowledge of the truth comes by contemplation, in accordance with the truth.</div>
<div class="line">Kata ñāṇa—the knowledge of the ending of the practice.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The ending of the first verses are about the 3 sāsana (Buddha's Teachings). These are called pariyatti, patipatti and pativeda. As pariññā; ñāta pariññā, tīraṇa pariññā and pahāna pariññā. As knowledge (ñāṇa); sacca ñāṇa, kicca ñāṇa and kata ñāṇa. These are the duties which have to fulfill them.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">① For learning by heart is the teacher's duty to teach and talk.</div>
<div class="line">② Practice is the yogi's or student's duty.</div>
<div class="line">③ Realization is the Dhamma's duty and it comes by itself with the practice.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Study of the 12 factors of D.A. process</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">① Avijjā (Ignorance)</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Avijjā means not knowing. This is not knowing of the Four Noble Truths. These are:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">(1) Not knowing the noble truth of dukkha (Dukkha Sacca).</div>
<div class="line">(2) Not knowing the noble truth of the origination of dukkha (Samudaya Sacca).</div>
<div class="line">(3) Not knowing the noble truth of the cessation of dukkha (Nirodha Sacca).</div>
<div class="line">(4) Not knowing the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of dukkha (Magga Sacca).</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>It's also not knowing what should be known and knowing what should not be known. Avijjā is also called delusion (moha). It has the function of delusion, and also has the nature of covering up.</p>
<p>Therefore avijjā is darkness. Also not knowing what is right and wrong. So it's also called wrong knowledge (micchā ñāṇa).</p>
<p>② Saṅkhāra (Volitional formation)</p>
<p>Here Saṅkhāra means actions condition for khandhas to arise.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">1. Saṅkhāra conditioning for the 5 khandhas to arise, i.e., mind and body.</div>
<div class="line">2. Saṅkhāra conditioning for the 4 mind khandhas to arise, i.e., nāmakkhandhas.</div>
<div class="line">3. Saṅkhāra conditioning for the body khandha, i.e., rūpakkhadha to arise.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">There are 3 kinds of saṅkhāra.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">(1) Puññābhisaṅkhāra-wholesome volitional formation</div>
<div class="line">It has 2 kinds; kāmāvacara puññābhisaṅkhāra—sense sphere of wholesome volitional formation, and rūpāvacara puññābhisaṅkhāra—fine material sphere of wholesome volitional formation.</div>
<div class="line">(2) Āpuññābhisaṅkhāra—unwholesome volitional formation.</div>
<div class="line">(3) Āneñjābhisaṅkhāra—volitional formation of immaterial jhāna.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Khandhas arise by different kinds of saṅkhāra.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">(1) Puññābhisaṅkhāra</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">(a) With kamavacara puññābhisaṅkhāra; human beings, heavenly being</div>
<div class="line">(b) With rūpāvacara puññābhisaṅkhāra, rūpabrahma khandhas.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">(2) Āpuññābhisaṅkhāra</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Beings in the 4 woeful planes (apāyabhūmi)</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">(3) Āneñjābhisaṅkhāra</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Ārūpabrahma khandhas</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The 31 planes of existence:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">(1) Kama sugati—sensual good destinations</div>
<div class="line">one human plane + 6 heavenly planes = 7 planes</div>
<div class="line">(2) Rūpabrahma planes = 16 planes</div>
<div class="line">(3) Ārūpabrahma planes = 4 planes</div>
<div class="line">(4) Woeful planes = 4 planes</div>
<div class="line">(Hell, animal, peta, and asura) 31 planes</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>③ Viññāṇa (consciousness)</p>
<p>Viññāṇa is knowing. There are 2 types of viññāṇa. Patisandhi viññāṇa rebirth-linking consciousness, consciousness during the pregnancy. And pavutti viññāṇa—consciousness arises in this present life, while still alive. Rebirth-linking consciousness had already gone. Now, we're living with these pavutti viññāṇa.</p>
<p>These are 6 types:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(1) Arising in the eye is eye-consciousness—cakkhu-viññāṇa.</div>
<div class="line">(2) Arising in the ear is ear-consciousness—sota-viññāṇa.</div>
<div class="line">(3) Arising in the nose is nose-consciousness—ghānaviññāṇa.</div>
<div class="line">(4) Arising on the tongue is tongue-consciousness—jivhāviññāṇa.</div>
<div class="line">(5) Arising in/on the body is body-consciousness—kāyaviññāṇa.</div>
<div class="line">(6) Arising in the heart is mind-consciousness—manoviññāṇa.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Nearly every living being is alive with these 6 consciousnesses. Except non-percipient beings (asaññasattā) and immaterial beings (arūpabrahmas), they are a little different from the mind-body beings. In every mind moment, it can only arise one consciousness. Because 2 consciousnesses can't arise together at the same moment.</p>
<p>④ Nāma-rūpa/ (Mind-matter)</p>
<p>Nāma—mind has the nature of inclining towards objects. And rūpa has the nature of change. Some examples of mind-matter are:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Wanting to eat is mind and eating is matter.</div>
<div class="line">Wanting to move is mind and moving is matter.</div>
<div class="line">Wanting to sit is mind and sitting is matter.</div>
<div class="line">The master is mind and the slave is matter.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">In nāma-rūpa, nāma has 4 groups and matter has one group.</div>
<div class="line">The 4 groups of nāma are:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">(1) vedanā—feeling</div>
<div class="line">(2) Saññā—perception</div>
<div class="line">(3) Saṅkhāra—Mental formation</div>
<div class="line">(4) viññāṇa—consciousness.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>⑤ Salāyatanaṁ (6 sense—bases)</p>
<p>The meaning of āyatana is dhamma extending the saṁsāra. Therefore the 6 sense—bases; eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind bases are extending the saṁsāra. Eye, ear, nose, tongue and body are 5 material bases. Heart or mind is mind base. Combine both of them become mind and body.</p>
<p>⑥ Phassa (Contact)</p>
<p>There are 6 contacts:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(1) Eye contacts with physical form—cakkhu samphassa rūpam.</div>
<div class="line">(2) Ear contacts with sound</div>
<div class="line">(3) Nose contacts with smell</div>
<div class="line">(4) Tongue contacts with taste</div>
<div class="line">(5) Body contacts with physical object</div>
<div class="line">(6) Mind contacts with mind object</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>⑦ vedanā (Feeling)</p>
<p>There are six types of feeling according to the six sense-doors. Feelings arise in the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind doors.</p>
<p>Analysis of feeling</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(a) Feelings in the body</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">(1) In the eye just only seeing is neutral feeling (upekkhā vedanā)</div>
<div class="line">(2) In the ear just only hearing is neutral feeling (upekkhā vedanā)</div>
<div class="line">(3) In the nose just only smelling is neutral feeling (upekkhā vedanā)</div>
<div class="line">(4) On the tongue just only tasting is neutral feeling (upekkhā vedanā)</div>
<div class="line">(5) In the body, pleasant and unpleasant feelings (sukha and dukkha, vedanās) arise.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Therefore with the whole physical body, pleasant and unpleasant and neutral feelings can arise.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">(b) Feelings in the mind</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">(1) With the pleasant feeling in/on the body and pleasant mental feeling (somanassa vedanā) arises.</div>
<div class="line">(2) With the unpleasant feeling in/on the body and unpleasant mental feeling (domanassa vedanā) arises.</div>
<div class="line">(3) With equanimity to things and neutral mental feeling (upekkhā) arises.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Therefore in the mind, pleasant, unpleasant and neutral feelings can arise. Combine all the body and mind feelings together only have 3 kinds of feelings i.e., pleasant, unpleasant and neutral feelings (sukha, dukkha, and upekkhā vedanā)</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>⑧ taṇhā (Craving)</p>
<p>taṇhā means wanting, craving; and has 3 types:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(1) Kama taṇhā—craving to the 5 cords of sensual pleasures.</div>
<div class="line">(2) Bhava taṇhā—craving for existence.</div>
<div class="line">(3) Vibhava—taṇhā without knowledge and not wanting any existence.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>The differences between (1) and (2) are; craving for external objects is kamma taṇhā and for the internal khandha is bhavataṇhā. Their nature is greed (lobha).</p>
<p>⑨ upādāna (Clinging)</p>
<p>There are 4 kinds of clinging;</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(1) Kāmupādāna—clinging to the 5 cords of sensual pleasure.</div>
<div class="line">(2) Diṭṭhupādāna—clinging to the 62 kinds of wrong views.</div>
<div class="line">(3) Sīlabbatupādāna clinging to rites and ceremonies (One Burmese teacher said, clinging to wrong practices are the right meaning, e.g., such practices as behave like a dog, a cow, etc. as mentioned in some suttas)</div>
<div class="line">(4) Attavādupādāna—Clinging to the doctrine of self, 20 types of identity views (sakkāya diṭṭhi).</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Four clingings, and combine together only has two. (1) is clinging with taṇhā. (2), (3) and (4) are clinging with diṭṭhi (views). taṇhā becomes stronger is upādāna. Both of them are lobha nature.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>⑩ Kammabhava (existence)</p>
<p>Kammabhava means kammically active process of existence or actions conditioning for existence. In the diagram of the D. A. process, kammabhava at sec ③ was written with incomplete form; such as:</p>
<img alt="Kamma-Bhava" class="align-center" src="//nanda.online-dhamma.net/extra/img/kamma-bhava.jpg" />
<p>It means Kamma and Bhava could be connected or disconnected. They are still connected for worldlings to sekhas (sotāpanna to anāgāmin); but not for arahants, pacceka-buddhas and Buddhas. Why is that? Because upapattibhava and kammabhava combine together only become completion (upapattibhava—passive or resultant process of existence). For an arahant it's only functional kamma and no more existence. In the original 12 factors of D. A. process was written as bhava only. Under the influence of clinging one engages in actions that are accumulated as kammas.</p>
<p>There are 3 types of kamma;</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(1) Bodily action</div>
<div class="line">(2) Verbal action</div>
<div class="line">(3) and Mental action.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Bodily action has 3 kinds:</div>
<div class="line">(a) Taking life</div>
<div class="line">(b) Stealing</div>
<div class="line">(c) Sexual misconduct.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Verbal action has 4 kinds:</div>
<div class="line">(a) Telling lies</div>
<div class="line">(b) Malicious Speech</div>
<div class="line">(c) Harsh speech</div>
<div class="line">(d) Frivolous talks</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Mental action has 3 kinds:</div>
<div class="line">(a) Covetousness (abhijjhā)</div>
<div class="line">(b)Ill-will (Vyāpāda)</div>
<div class="line">(c)Wrong view—not believing in kamma.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>All these 10 negative kammas are called 10 unwholesome dhamma (akusala dhamma) or 10 duccarita dhamma (misconducts) or 10 apuññābhisaṅkhāra (black kammas). These dhammas can lead to bad destinations (dugati). To avoid them become 10 wholesome dhamma (kusala dhamma) or 10 good conducts (sucarita dhamma) or 10 puññābhisaṅkhāra, (white kammas). These can lead to good destinations (sugati).</p>
<p>The 3 wholesome mental actions (mano kusala kamma)are:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(1) Anabhijjhā—joy and gladness in others' successes.</div>
<div class="line">(2) Avyāpāda—has metta (loving kindness) on others.</div>
<div class="line">(3) Sammādiṭṭhi—right view, here is believing in the law of kamma.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The differences between saṅkhāra and kammabhava are:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">(1) Saṅkhāra was past kamma and kammabhava is the present one.</div>
<div class="line">(2) Saṅkhāra had given the result and kammabhava not yet.</div>
<div class="line">(3) The result of saṅkhāra had already arisen and can't do anything about it. The result of kammabhava is not arising yet. So with the help of a good teacher and practice can make it becomes fruitless.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>⑪ jāti (Birth)</p>
<p>Getting a new life or khandhas.</p>
<p>There are 4 kinds of births:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(1) Born from a mother's womb—jalābuja.</div>
<div class="line">(2) Born from an egg—aṇdaja.</div>
<div class="line">(3) Born from inside the woods, bamboos, moss, decomposed meats and fishes, these beings attached to these things saṁsedaja (many kinds of worms and can be regarded as natural cloning).</div>
<div class="line">(4) Spontaneous births—opapātika (e.g., heavenly beings)—having their full grown sizes with births.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The differences between (3) and (4) are: saṁsedaja beings were rare and small and grown up slowly, e.g., lotus born human.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Beings also can have different numbers of khandha. Some have 5 khandhas, some have 4 mind khandhas (e.g., arūpabranma) and some only have the physical khandha (e.g., non-percipient beings).</p>
<p>⑫ Jara, maraṇa (Ageing and death)</p>
<p>There are 4 kinds of death</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(1) Die after kammic energy has consumed—kammakkhaya maraṇa.</div>
<div class="line">(2) Die after life span has consumed Āyukhaya maraṇa.</div>
<div class="line">(3) Die after with both kammic energy and life span have consumed- ubayakkhaya maraṇa.</div>
<div class="line">(4) Die after the physical process is cutting off with destruction—upaghātaka maraṇa. (e.g., killed by accident).</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Note on Kammabhava:</p>
<p>On the factor of kammabhava and has mentioned about the bodily action—kāya kamma. It doesn't include taking intoxicants (liquors and drugs). Also, we can't find it in the 10 unwholesome kammas. In the 5 precepts the last one is abstinence from intoxicants.</p>
<p>We know that it's very harmful to human beings and society and no doubts about it. If we break this one precept and can break all the other four. Even the Buddha mentioned about its future result was not good. So why don't we find it in the 10 unwholesome kammas? A Burmese teacher said that it was including in the sexual misconduct.</p>
<p>But he didn't explain the reason. Truly, sexual desire is intoxicating. Because of sexual desire, some had done unlawful and wrong sexual practices. Such as adhamma rāga and micchā dhamma mentioned in some suttas, moral of humans was degenerated when the time came. Nowadays we can see more and more these things in society.</p>
