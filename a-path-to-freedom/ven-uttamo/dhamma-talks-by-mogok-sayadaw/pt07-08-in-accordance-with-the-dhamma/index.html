<p>Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 16th November 1961</p>
<p>There are 5 dullābha (Difficult to encounter/gain):</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">① Now you are all encountering of the Buddha’s Teachings</div>
<div class="line">② Also meet a teacher who can teach sacca dhamma</div>
<div class="line">③ You have the ear for listening the sacca dhamma.</div>
<div class="line">④ Can discern impermanence by practice – Practice in accordance with the Dhamma – Dhammanudhammapatipatti. You have completed with these 4 points.</div>
<div class="line">⑤ Can pay homage to the Buddha and teacher with Nibbāna which is the ending of impermanence.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Some has already fulfilled this point also. They are not so few. You all are my veneyya (enlighten by his instructions). The Buddha’s veneyyas were starting from the Pañcavaggi Bhikkhus (The first five-group of disciples) to the last bhikkhu Subhadda. So, the other people have to fulfill the ④ and ⑤ points with perseverance in the practice.</p>
<p>I’ll talk about the practice in accordance with the Dhamma. Mind and form dhamma are in the body. You have to practice accordingly with them. You know its arising if it shows the arising. If, it shows the vanishing and you know its vanishing. The showing process is dhamma. Anupatipatti is practising accordingly.</p>
<p>Know its disenchantment if it’s showing disenchantment. Know its upekkhā if it’s showing upekkhā. These are anupatipatti. (from the Aṅguttara Nikāya). You all have the perfection (pāramī). Just fulfill this point (i.e., no. 4). This is important. To get it, you have to do the practice by yourself. With the practice, you’ll complete it. For example, sleepy mind arises and you know it as arising.</p>
<p>If, it’s vanishing and you know it as vanishing, etc. It takes longer time if kilesa comes in. If not coming in, it might take a week or seven days (to fulfill). Even you can achieve it by practice in the morning and realize in the evening. It can be fulfilled from ① to ③ by prayers. No. ④ is only with practicing by yourself.</p>
<p>It's sure for you to realize it if you can make your knowledge accordingly with impermanence. No. ④ is more important than no. ⑤. The reason is no. ④ the insight knowledge must be sharp for no. ⑤ Path Knowledge to arise Path knowledge. Have to contemplate as the arising is dukkha and the vanishing is dukkha. Their ending is the cessation of dukkha.</p>
<p>No. ④ has the five path factors and ⑤ has the eight path factors. The path knowledge, the fruition knowledge and the reviewing knowledge (Paccavekkhana Ñāṇa), all are seeing the cessation of dukkha (i.e., Nibbāna).</p>
<p>The body becomes light and the heart becomes cool. (Sayadaw continued the Sakka Pañha Sutta). Not being free from diseases and illnesses are the reason of issā and macchariya (envy and avarice). Craving, conceit and wrong view come from feeling.</p>
<p>[And then Sayadaw talked about living beings were oppressed and killed by the three feelings. Giving a simile of a fish, a fish is seeing a bait (upekkhā) and wants to eat it (sukha). It gulps the bait and pulls up by the fisherman and beats to death (dukkha)].</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> From the beginning of this talk, Sayadaw mentioned these words “Some have already fulfilled this point also. They are not so few. You all are my veneyya (enlighten by his instructions). These are referring to no. 5 point which is Nibbāna. This is inspiring and encouraging for us who study his talks. I have no doubt about the success of his teaching. The yogis he referred were the ones who often listened to his talks every day two or three times for many years at three places (Amarapura, Mandalay and Mogok). Some stayed at these centers and practiced under his guidance for a long retreat.</p>
<p>The three talks here: The Hidden Treasure, Priceless Treasure of Mankind and In Accordance with the Dhamma, all were delivered on 16th November 1961. In the Dhamma list of that year (i.e., November and December 1961) he gave two or three talks a day. The reason behind is some lay people led by U Tan Daing from Rangoon came to Amarapura and had a long retreat with Sayadawgyi. Mogok Sayadaw was a remarkable Dhamma workaholic and non-stop working for the Buddha Dhamma. There were some who had the misconception that Arahant Ideal was selfish. This is totally wrong and non-sense.</p>
