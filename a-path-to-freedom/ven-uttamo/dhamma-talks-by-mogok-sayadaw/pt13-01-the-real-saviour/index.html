<p>Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 28th July 1961</p>
<p>Wasting time in with worldly matters and not doing insight practice is like watering a poisonous tree. Listening to Dhamma and practicing it are the tasks to save oneself. When you were young and didn’t have times. Again, after grown up you’re busy with family matters. Therefore, you’re coming to this human world as like animals (just knowing only—eating, sleeping and sensuality).</p>
<p>Only by conquering defilements of the mind (kilesa) will become stream enterer (sotāpanna) to arahant. Kilesas are hiding in the khandha (i.e., the mind). Would kilesa die out without seeing its faults? Kilesa will not die if you not discern the impermanence of the khandha, or not understand its dukkha nature, or cannot contemplate its uncontrollable nature of not-self and its loathsome nature. You’ll conquer kilesa if you can discern one of these four points. Without cutting off the process of the khandha, it will continue. The cessation of khandha and taṇhā is Nibbāna. The task will finish only with the cessation of two truths of round of existence (vaṭṭa sacca) and the arising of two truths of no-round of existence (vivaṭṭa sacca) (two vaṭṭa saccas are Dukkha and Samudaya Saccas; two vivaṭṭa saccas are Nirodha and Magga Saccas).</p>
<p>People become blind and crazy by not knowing about the khandha and kilesa. Their past lives were also lived as crazy and blind beings that they had fallen into various kinds of gorges. Therefore, you should not lazy for the Dhamma practice. You don’t need pāramīs if you discern the impermanence of phenomena. (This point is very important for all Buddhists, especially for practicing yogis. Some Buddhists did not know the Pāḷi Nikāyas became confused and relied on the outside power and invented new ideas.) The impermanence and path factors (i.e., anicca and magga) will lead one to Nibbāna. You have to put down the family and economic matters because it can’t save you. There are a lot of dirty things inside your stomach. (such as—sweat and dirt flow from the body; from its nine openings: muck from the eyes, wax from the ears, snot from the nostrils, from the mouth vomits bile and phlegm, from anus and urethra come out smelly things. From the loathsome body all these disgusting and foul—smelling impurity flows.) We’re carrying this loathsome body and wandering around and view it as a grace.</p>
<p>Practice vipassanā without any concern for this body. Actions (kamma) controlled by craving (taṇhā) and clinging (upādāna) are very disgusting. All died without the knowledge of D. A. teaching had wrong views because they died with diṭṭhi-taṇhā. They died with the three distortions of wrong perception, wrong knowing and viewing. The Buddha himself mentioned that no listening of suññatā Dhamma all died with wrong view. How much frightening it was? (The Buddha also said that the frequent homes of living beings were the three woeful planes of hell, animal and ghost realms. We should reflect these points very often.) Could you climb up again to this human world? You are near to suññatā Nibbāna if discern emptiness (i.e., suññatā). You’ll fall into woeful existences by not seeing suññatā.</p>
<p>The attainment of the holy Dhamma is not easy. Every day the unwholesome kammas (actions) arise from the six senses of doors are our enemies. (we create these enemies ourselves for sufferings.) It will not easy to climb up again if you fall into painful existence (apāya). At here many are near to death and it’s more important for them. (This referred to old lay disciples who were sitting near Sayadaw). Bhāvetabba (contemplate for many times) refers to vipassanā magga (insight path factors). We have to make friends with vipassanā magga which discern anicca. (Living beings are making friends with unwholesome and wholesome kammas. In reality, we must make friends with knowledge—ñāṇa.) In this way our real Saviour (vipassanā magga) appears in our heart. (Without a Buddha all living beings are looking for God and their Saviour outside themselves. They will never find one.)</p>
