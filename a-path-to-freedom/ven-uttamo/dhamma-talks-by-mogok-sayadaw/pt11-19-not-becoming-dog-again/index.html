<p>Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; no date noted</p>
<p>[Sometimes Sayadaw’s talks were like a lion’s roar; fearless and only regarding for the truths, not concerned about the listeners’ status and wealth. In the sutta, the Buddha described it very simple but profoundly. Because of Sayadaw’s sharp mind some of his profound talks were strong saṁvega and humorous. It could give the listeners different tastes of Dhamma/Dhamma rasa.]</p>
<p>In the Khandhavagga Saṁyutta, the Buddha taught clearly that we should not have affections to the dukkha khandhas. For this the Buddha gave the simile of a dog. A dog was bound with a collar and rope to a strong post. So it couldn’t run away from the post. (There are two suttas with the name of “Leash”. Sayadaw based his talk on the second sutta. SN.22.100 Dutiyagaddulabaddhasuttaṃ.)</p>
<p>It only could run around the post with its collar and rope. It became an ageing, sick and dying dog at the foot of the post. The dog was eating, drinking, urinating and excreting near around it. Its ugliness was no end. The collar and rope were not cutting off and the post not came out. So, it couldn’t see any freedom. It was unpleasant for others to see it.</p>
<p>The Buddha wanted to show our ugliness so that he gave this simile. The strong post represented the five khandhas. Attachment to the khandha was the strong rope. Taking them as me and mine was the diṭṭhi collar. Deluded, crazy and blind worldling was the dog. Don’t take it as an offending remark. Your foolishness and stupidity are not different from this dog.</p>
<p>If you still have taṇhā/māna rope, diṭṭhi collar and clinging to the khandha post is like this dog. It is also the same way if you want to go celestial realms and brahma god realms. Praying for the becoming is changing post; i.e., as human being, celestial being, etc. because you don’t want to be free as dog mentioned above.</p>
<p>The power of not knowing/ignorance is so great that people are saying things and doing things whatever they want. (Just reflect on nowadays human and the Earth problems).</p>
<p>Now, praying is only for becoming a dog. If becoming worse than that, just go to avīci hell. Don’t be ended up with the artists, but at truth. (This referred to art drawings and books which describ e about celestial realms without really seeing with their own eyes.)</p>
<p>Khandha is dukkha sacca (i.e., the post); rope and collar are samudaya sacca and the dog is the sufferer (dukkha beings). Beings make their own posts; bind themselves with ropes and put on collars and running around their posts in circle, showing themselves in the 31 realms of existence without shame. Not doing vipassanā practice, the post, rope and collar will be never broken off; and then they will never be free from becoming a dog. (Nowadays dog culture is extremely popular. It seems dog numbers are nearly overcome human number. Where are these dogs coming from?)</p>
<p>The post is broken off if you see the impermanence of the five khandhas. Not connecting with taṇhā, the rope is also cutting off; and then not seeing the khandha as this is mine, this I am and this is myself. (Not taking the khandha with taṇhā, māna and diṭṭhi).</p>
<p>It becomes a spiritual worldling from a crazy worldling (From andha puthujjana to kalyāna puthujjana). And then you’re not happy to be at the base of the post. You make the decision for digging out the post, so continue the contemplation. If developing to the knowledge of disenchantment and has the seed of a stream enterer. With the disenchantment and continue the contemplation without giving up.</p>
<p>All are included if you choose one of the contemplations (with one of the four satipaṭṭhānas). There is no need to contemplate all the five khandhas. With the knowledge of not wanting and free from this is mine, this I am and this is myself. The post, the rope and collar are falling off. Except vipassanā there is no other true refuge. If you have compassion for yourself and just do the practice. You must have to do it.</p>
