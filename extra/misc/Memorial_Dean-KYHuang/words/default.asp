		”Death leaves a heartache no one can heal, love leaves a memory no one can steal.”<br>-From a headstone in Ireland<br><br>We mourn the loss of our beloved Dean Kun-yen Huang. We are deeply grieved.  We have lost a great teacher and an extraordinary mentor.<br><br>With respect to his role as a mentor, our Dean was unparalleled in that line. In his microbiology lectures, he was a born teacher who could kindle our attention to provoke us to think.  Moreover, his formal speeches were not only captivating and stimulating but also inspirational and empowering.  His charisma might have enthralled us but the messages conveyed in these speeches always betokened us some significant issues that would affect our lives in the near future.  <br><br>Dean Huang was indeed a remarkable man and because he was, so many of us were made better by it.  He will live forever in the hearts of each of us he touched, and even further beyond us because of the people we meet in our work.  This is the kind of legacy he has left us.<br><br>We will miss him dearly and I believe that the following lines truly express our feelings to our Dean Kun-yen Huang.<br><br>Those we love don't go away,<br>They walk beside us everyday,<br>Unseen, unheard, but always near,<br>Still loved, still missed and very dear. <br>-Anonymous<br><br>Chiun-Sheng Chen<br>------台南市立醫院陳俊生
