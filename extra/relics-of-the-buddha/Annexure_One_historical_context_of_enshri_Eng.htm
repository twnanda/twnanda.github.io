</FONT><FONT FACE="Original-Garamond-Pali,Courier New" COLOR="#ffffff"><P>2550 years ago, the full-moon night of Vesak was gradually coming to an end. Gotama Buddha was lying under twin sal trees near the boundary of the Kushinagar, the capital town of the Mallas. He would attain </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Garamond Pali,Times New Roman" COLOR="#ffffff">parinibb±na</FONT><FONT FACE="Original-Garamond-Pali,Courier New" COLOR="#ffffff"> </I>shortly. At this time, his attendant, Nanda asked him:</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Original-Garamond-Pali,Courier New" COLOR="#ffffff"><P>Venerable sir, what should we do with the body of the Tathagata (after </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Garamond Pali,Times New Roman" COLOR="#ffffff">parinibbaana</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Original-Garamond-Pali,Courier New" COLOR="#ffffff">)? </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="新細明體" LANG="ZH-TW" COLOR="#ffffff">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Original-Garamond-Pali,Courier New" COLOR="#ffffff"><P>The Buddha gave detailed instructions regarding the cremation of his body and gave the following directions about the mortal remains/relics after cremation.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="新細明體" LANG="ZH-TW" COLOR="#ffffff">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Original-Garamond-Pali,Courier New" COLOR="#ffffff"><P> (The relics of) the Tathagata should be enshrined in a stupa at the cross-roads (prominent place) in the capital city.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="新細明體" LANG="ZH-TW" COLOR="#ffffff">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Original-Garamond-Pali,Courier New" COLOR="#ffffff"><P>Seeing the situation take a turn for the worse, a wise devotee, Brahmin Dooa, pacified all the claimants. He divided the relics into eight parts and gave one part to each of the rulers so that they could build a stupa enshrining these relics in their respective capital cities. </FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond Pali,Times New Roman" COLOR="#ffffff">Dooa</FONT><FONT FACE="Original-Garamond-Pali,Courier New" COLOR="#ffffff"> asked for the vessel in which the relics were kept so that he could build a stupa enshrining it in his village.</P>

They were devoted to the Buddha and so they arrived to claim their share of the relics. However the relics had already been distributed. Therefore, they had to be satisfied with the residual ashes from the funeral pyre. They built a magnificent stupa upon these ashes in their capital. Thus, immediately after the Buddha’s <I>parinibb±na, </I>ten great stupas were built in his honour.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="新細明體" LANG="ZH-TW" COLOR="#ffffff">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Original-Garamond-Pali,Courier New" COLOR="#ffffff"><P>During his reign, Emperor Asoka obtained the relics from some of these stupas and dividing them into smaller portions, he respectfully enshrined them in innumerable stupas in different towns in his vast empire. The Archaeological Department of the Government of India excavated the ruins of these stupas and obtained relics from some of them. These relics are kept in museums in New Delhi and in other state museums such as Patna museum.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Original-Garamond-Pali,Courier New" COLOR="#ffffff"><P>During the lifetime of the Buddha, soon after his enlightenment, Tapussa and Bhallika, two Indian merchants living in Myanmar met the Buddha. The Buddha gave them eight strands of his hair. Taking these strands with them back to their country, they respectfully enshrined them in the Shwe Dagon in Yangon. In accordance with the final instructions of the Buddha, these hair relics are suitably reverenced by the people there.</P></FONT></BODY>
