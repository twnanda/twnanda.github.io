<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 131. Thus have I heard: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time the Bhagava was residing at Rajagaha,
on the Gijjhakuta <sup>1</sup> hill. During that time the king of Magadha,
Ajatasattu, son of Queen Vedehi, wanted to attack the Vajji princes, and
declared thus: <font color="#0000FF">"I shall annihilate these Vajji
princes, powerful and mighty<sup>2 </sup>as they are. I shall destroy them,
bring them to utter rack and ruin."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 132. Then King Ajatasattu of Magadha, son of Queen
Vedehi, called to him the Chief Minister of Magadha, the brahmin Vassakara, and
said to him:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">"Come, brahmin, go to
the Bhagava, and pay homage at his feet, carrying my words. Enquire whether the
Bhagava is free from illness and affliction, whether he is enjoying bodily
vigour, strength, ease and comfort. Say to the Bhagava 'Venerable Sir, King
Ajatasattu of Magadha, son of Queen Vedehi, pays homage at your feet. He
enquires by me whether the Bhagava; is free from illness and affliction,
whether he is enjoying bodily vigour, strength, ease and comfort'. And say thus
to him, 'He wishes to attack the Vajji princes and has declared that he will
annihilate the Vajji princes, powerful and mighty as they are, and that he will
destroy them and bring them to utter rack and ruin.' And carefully noting what
the Bhagava says, repeat to me his remarks. The Tathagatas never speak what is
untrue."</font></p>
<hr align="CENTER" width="70%">

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. powerful and mighty, through harmonious union
and military preparedness.</p>

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 133. The brahmin Vassakara, Chief Minister of
Magadha, said <font color="#0000FF">"Very well, Your Majesty,"</font>
in assent to King Ajjatasattu of Magadha, son of Queen Vedehi. And he had
excellent and elegant carriages harnessed, and mounting an excellent carriage,
left Rajagaha for the Gijjhakuta hill, accompanied by other excellent
carriages. After proceeding as far as the carriage might properly go, he
dismounted from the carriage, and approached the Bhagava on foot. After
offering courteous greetings to the Bhagava and having said memorable words of
felicitation, the Chief Minister, the brahmin Vassakara, seated himself on one
side, and thus addressed the Bhagava:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000FF"> "Venerable Gotama, King
Ajatasattu of Magadha, son of Queen Vedehi, pays homage at your feet. He
enquires after (the state of) your health, your vigour, strength, ease and
comfort. He wishes to attack the Vajji princes, and has declared that he will
annihilate them, powerful and mighty as they are, and that he will destroy them
and bring them to utter rack and ruin."</font> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 142. While the

existence as set out in the Four Noble Truths."</i></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Bhagava,
accompanied by many bhikkhus, went to the Ambalatthika garden and stayed at the

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 151. And the Bhagava
spent the greater part of the night instructing the devotees of Patali village
in the Teaching, causing them to realize (the benefits of) the Dhamma, to
become established in (the observance of) the Teaching, and to be filled with
gladness and enthusiasm for (the practice of) the Teaching. Then he sent them
away, saying<i><font color="#800040"> "The night is far advanced,

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The devotees of
Patali village assented, saying <font color="#0000ff">"Very well,
Venerable Sir"</font>, and arising from their seats, made obeisance to the
Bhagava and departed respectfully. Then the Bhagava, not long after the
departure of the devotees of Patali village, retired in seclusion.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="11"></a><font color="#0000ff" size="+2">Founding of
the (fortified) City of Pataliputta</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 152. At that time,
(the brahmins) Sunidha and Vassakara, chief ministers of Magadha Kingdom, were
building a (fortified) city at the (site of) Patali village to keep out the
Vajji princes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During that period,
many devas, in groups of a thousand each, were taking possession of plots of
land at the Patali village.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the locations
where the devas of great power had taken possession of plots of land, there
princes and king's ministers of great power were inclined to build (lit., their
minds were bent towards building) houses. And where the devas of medium power
had taken possession of plots of land, there princes and king's ministers of
medium power were inclined to build houses. And where the devas of lesser power
had taken possession of plots of land, there princes and king's ministers of
lesser power were inclined to build houses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bhagava saw by
means of <i>dibba-cakkhu, </i>(the extremely clear and divine power of vision,
comparable to the vision-faculty of the devas and surpassing the seeing ability
of men), those devas who were gathered in groups of a thousand each and who
were taking possession of plots of land in the Patali village. Then the Bhagava
arose at dawn and asked the Venerable Ananda,<i><font color="#800040">
"Ananda, who are building a (fortified) city at the (site of) Patali
village ?"</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000a0">
"Venerable Sir, (the brahmins) Sunidha and Vassakara, chief ministers of

<font color="#800040"><i></i></font> <p><font color="#800040"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 153. Then, the chief
ministers of Magadha, (the brahmins) Sunidha and Vassakara, went to the
Bhagava. After offering courteous greetings to the Bhagava and having said
memorable words of felicitation, the chief ministers stood on one side, and
said, <font color="#0000ff">"Venerable Sir, may it please the Venerable
Gotama to accept our offering of food for today, together with the company of
bhikkhus."</font> The Bhagava, by silence, signified acceptance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the Magadha
chief ministers, Sunidha and Vassakara, knowing that the Bhagava had accepted
their request, went to their house and having prepared at their house choice
food and eatables, both hard and soft kinds, they informed the Bhagava that it
was time, by the message,<font color="#0000ff"> "Venerable Gotama, it is
time (to proceed), the food-offering is ready."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in the morning
time the Bhagava re-arranged his robes, and taking alms-bowl and great robe,
went to the house of the Magadha chief ministers, Sunidha and Vassakara, in
the, company of the bhikkhus, and took the seat prepared for him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Magadha chief
ministers, Sunidha and Vassakara, personally attended on the Bhagava and the
bhikkhus, offering the choice food and eatables with their own hands till the
Bhagava and the bhikkhus caused them to stop, signifying they had had enough. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Bhagava had
finished his meal and had removed his hand from his alms-bowl, the Magadha
chief ministers, Sunidha and Vassakara, took low seats and sat down on one
side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Magadha chief
ministers, Sunidha and Vassakara, who were thus seated, the Bhagava signified
his pleasure and appreciation by these verses (rendered below in prose):</p>
<blockquote> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> "Brahmins, when the wise man offers food to those
endowed with moral conduct, self-control, and purity of life, at the place
where he has made his home, he should share the merit of the alms-giving with
the devas of that place. (When merit is thus shared with them), the devas being
honoured, honour him (the sharer of merit) in return; being revered, revere him
in return. Therefore, just as a mother safeguards her own son, the devas
safeguard the sharer of merit. And the person who is under the protection of
the devas meets with only good fortune at all times." </i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After signifying his
pleasure and appreciation by these verses to the Magadha chief ministers,
Sunidha and Vassakara, the Bhagava arose from his seat and left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 154. Then, the
Magadha chief ministers, Sunidha and Vassakara, thinking "We shall call
the gateway by which the Venerable Gotama leaves today, the Gotama Gateway, and
the landing place by which the Venerable Gotama crosses the river Ganges, the
Gotama Landing Place," followed the Bhagava all along the route.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gateway by which
the Bhagava then left came to be known as the Gotama Gateway. When the Bhagava
approached the river Ganges, the river was full to the brim so that a crow on
the bank might easily drink from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people, who
wanted to cross from one shore to the other, looked for boats. Others looked
for log rafts. Still others built bamboo rafts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, as
instantaneously as a strong man stretches his bent arm or bends his
outstretched arm, even so the Bhagava vanished from this side of the Ganges and
reappeared on the other shore together with the company of bhikkhus. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bhagava saw the
people who wanted to cross from one shore to the other looking for boats, for
log rafts, or making bamboo rafts. Then, the Bhagava, seeing them thus, uttered
these exultant words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font color="#800040">"The (ariya) persons have crossed the deep and wide river
of tanha, craving, by building the bridge of ariyamagganana, Noble Magga
Insight, leaving behind him marshy grounds of moral defilements. As for the
(non-ariya) persons, they have to build rafts (to cross the river). However,
the wise ariya persons, who have crossed (the river of craving), have no more
need to make rafts."</font></i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 155. Then the Bhagava
said to the Venerable Ananda, <i><font color="#800040">"Come, Ananda, let
us go to Koti village." </font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Venerable Ananda
respectfully assenting, the Bhagava, accompanied by a large number of bhikkhus,
went to Koti village and dwelt there. During that time, the Bhagava addressed
the bhikkhus thus:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Bhagava had
spoken the above words, he further said these verses: </p>
<p><i><font color="#800040">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

rooted out. The root of dukkha has been cut off without any vestige remaining.
Now, there will be no more rebirth." </font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Bhagava was
thus sojourning at that Koti village, he repeatedly expounded to the bhikkhus
this very discourse:</p>

Bhagava, after staying at Koti village as long as he wished, said to the
Venerable Ananda, <i><font color="#800040">"Come, Ananda, let us go to

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Venerable Ananda

and true (Sugata); he knows all the three lokas (Lokavidu); he is incomparable
in taming those who deserve to be tamed (Anuitaro purisa dammasarathi); he is
the Teacher of devas and men (Sattha devamanussanam); he is the Enlightened

"The Teaching of the Bhagava, the Dhamma, is well-expounded, Svakkhata,
(because it is the exposition of the Four Noble Truths which lead to the
realization of Nibbana). Its truths are personally appreciable, Sanditthika,
(because they can actually be experienced and comprehended by anyone through
adequate practice of Insight development). It is not delayed in its results,
Akalika, (because it immediately yields the benefit of realization of Nibbana,
i.e., achieving phala immediately after magga, to anyone who adequately
practises Insight development). It can stand investigation, Ehipassika, (lit.,
come and see), (because its truths can be tested by anyone). It is worthy of
being perpetually borne in mind Opaneyyika. And its truths can be realized and
experienced by the ariyas individually, by their own effort and practice,
Paccattam Veditabba Vinnuhi. </i></font></p>
<p><font color="#800040"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The

<p><font color="#800040"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"the disciples of the Bhagava, the Samgha, are endowed with right
practice, Suppatipanna, (because the Samgha practise the right practice, i.e.,
the development of the Noble Path of Eight Constituents). They are endowed with
straightforward uprightness, Ujuppatipanna. (because the Samgha diligently and
unswervingly follow the Straight Middle Way, i.e., the Noble Path of Eight
Constituents). They are endowed with right conduct, Nayappatipanna, (because
the practice of the Samgha is solely directed to the realisation of Nibbana).
They are endowed with correctness in practice, Samicippatipanna, (because the
Samgha devotedly cultivate the development of the Noble Path of Eight
Constituents). The disciples of the Bhagava, the Samgha, consisting of eight
categories or four pairs<sup>3</sup> of disciples of the Bhagava, are worthy of
receiving offerings brought even from afar, Ahuneyya. They are worthy of
receiving offerings specially set aside for guests, Pahuneyya. They are worthy
of receiving offerings donated for well-being in the next existence,
Dakkhineyya; and are worthy of receiving obeisance, Anjalikaraniya. They are
the incomparably fertile field for all to sow the seed of merit, Anuttaram

<p><font color="#800040"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
ariya disciple is endowed with sila, morality, which leads to liberation from
slavery to tanha, craving; which is praised by the wise; which is untarnished
(by tanha and ditthi, craving and wrong view); which is conducive to
concentration of mind; which is unbroken, intact, unblemished and unspotted and
which is cherished by the ariyas.</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#800040"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ananda, a noble (ariya) disciple who is fully endowed with (lit., who
completely possesses) this Mirror of Wisdom, can, if he wishes to, say of
himself, "For me there is no possibility of being reborn in the realm of
continuous suffering (niraya), or in the realm of animals, or in the realm of
famished spirits (peta), or of falling to ruin (in any) of the sub-human,
miserable realms (apaya). I have become a Sotapanna, not liable to fall into
realms of misery and suffering; assured am I of a good destination and of
attaining (the three higher levels of Insight, culminating in)
Enlightenment." This is the exposition of the Mirror of Wisdom.</i></font>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Bhagava was
sojourning at the brick building at that Natika village, too, he repeatedly
expounded this very discourse:</p>
<p><font color="#800040"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Such is sila, morality; such is samadhi, concentration of mind; such is
panna, wisdom. Samadhi, when based upon sila, is rich in result and of great
effect. Panna when based upon samadhi, is rich in result and of great effect.
The mind, when developed through panna, is thoroughly liberated from the
asavas, moral intoxicants, taints, namely, kamasava, the taint of sensuous
desire, bhavasava, the taint of hankering after repeated existence, and
avijjasava, the taint of ignorance of the true nature of existence as set out
in the Four Noble Truths."</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 160. Then the
Bhagava, after staying at Natika village as long as he wished, said to the
Venerable Ananda, <i><font color="#800040">"Come, Ananda, let us go to
Vesali."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Venerable Ananda
assented, saying<font color="#0000ff"> "Very well, Venerable
Sir."</font> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Bhagava,
accompanied by many bhikkhus, went to Vesali, and stayed at Ambapali's grove.
At that time the Bhagava addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>
<p><font color="#800040"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should live with mindfulness and clear comprehension. This
is our exhortation to you. How is the bhikkhu to be mindful? Bhikkhus, the
bhikkhu (i.e., the disciple) following the practice of my Teaching keeps his
mind steadfastly on the body ( kaya), with diligence, comprehension and
mindfulness, and perceives its impermanent, insecure, soulless and unpleasant
nature), thus keeping away covetousness and distress (which will appear if he
is not mindful of the five khandhas). He keeps his mind steadfastly on
sensation (Vedana) ....... (and perceives its impermanent, insecure, and
soulless nature) ....... He concentrates steadfastly on the mind (citta)
....... He keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma<sup>4</sup> with diligence,
comprehension and mindfulness, (and perceives their impermanent, insecure, and
soulless nature), thus keeping away covetousness and distress (which will
appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhas). Bhikkhus, this is how the
bhikkhu is to be mindful.</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#800040"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bhikkhus, how does a bhikkhu exercise clear comprehension? Bhikkhus, the
bhikkhu following the practice of my Teaching exercises clear comprehension in
moving forward or back; in looking straight ahead or sideways; in bending or
stretching; in carrying or wearing the double-layered robe, alms-bowl and the
other two robes; in eating, drinking, chewing, savouring (food and beverages);
in defecating and urinating; in walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep,
waking, speaking, or in keeping silent. Bhikkhus, this is how the bhikkhu
exercises clear comprehension. Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu should remain in
mindfulness and clear comprehension. This is our exhortation to you.</i></font>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. faith:
<i>aveccappasadena, </i>with perfect, absolute <i>(avecca) </i>(ava+i+ tva);
'serene satisfaction in, confidence in, inclination of the heart towards'
<i>(pasada). </i>Although this term is rendered here as 'faith', for the sake
of readability of the text, it is not blind faith, unquestioning acceptance on
trust, but rather 'confidence based on conviction, on reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Sammasambudlha: He
who, has attained Sabbannutanana, Perfect Wisdom through self-enlightenment. An
abridged rendering is "The Perfectly Self-Enlightened".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. four pairs: there
are eight categories of disciples, namely, four attainers of Magga-nana, and
four attainers of Phala-nana. Magga-nana is the flash of Insight into Nibbana,
and Phala-nana is the Fruition or repeated insight into Nibbana; and so
attainers of Magga-nana and Phala-nana come in pairs. Hence four pairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. dhamma: The five
dhammas consisting of (1) five nivaranas; (2) five khadhas; (3) twelve
ayatanas; (4) seven bojjhangas; and (5) four ariya saccas. See

the Courtesan</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 161. Ambapali, the
courtesan, heard that the Bhagava had arrived at Vesali and that the Bhagava
was staying at her mango grove. Then Ambapali, the courtesan, caused excellent
and elegant carriages to be harnessed, and mounting an excellent carriage, left
Vesali for her mango grove, accompanied by other excellent carriages. After
going in the carriage as far as carriages should properly go, she dismounted
from her carriage and approached the Bhagava on foot. She made obeisance to the
Bhagava and sat on one side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Bhagava, by
his discourse to Ambapali sitting on one side, caused her to realize (the
benefits of) the Dhamma, to become established in (the observance of) the
Teaching, and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm for (the practice of)
the Teaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Bhagava had
caused her to realize (the benefits of) the Teaching, to become established in
(the observance of) the Teaching, and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm
for (the practice of) the Teaching, Ambapali, the courtesan, said to the
Bhagava, <font color="#ff00ff">"Venerable Sir, may it please the Bhagava
to accept my offering of food for tomorrow, together with the company of
bhikkhus."</font> The Bhagava, by silence, signified his acceptance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Ambapali, the
courtesan, knowing that the Bhagava had accepted her request, rose from her
seat, made obeisance to the Bhagava, and left respectfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Licchavi princes
who were at Vesali heard that the Bhagava had reached Vesali and was staying at
the orchard of Ambapali. Then the Licchavi princes caused excellent and elegant
carriages to be harnessed, mounted them, and accompanied by other elegant
carriages, left Vesali.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of these (Licchavi
princes) some princes were dressed in dark-blue clothes, with dark-blue
ornaments, presenting a dark-blue appearance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some princes were
dressed in yellow clothes, with yellow ornaments, presenting a yellow
appearance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some princes were
dressed in red clothes, with red ornaments, presenting a red appearance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some princes were
dressed in white clothes, with white ornaments, presenting a white appearance. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Ambapali, the
courtesan, let her carriage strike against the carriages of the young Licchavi
princes, axle against axle, wheel against wheel, yoke against yoke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Licchavi
princes said to Ambapali the courtesan,<font color="#0000ff"> 'Now then,
Ambapali! Why do you let your carriage strike against the carriages of the
young Licchavi princes, axle against axle, wheel against wheel, yoke against
yoke?"</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#ff00ff">"It is indeed this way, O my princes. It is because I have
invited the Bhagava to a meal tomorrow, together with the company of
bhikkhus."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">
"Now then, Ambapali! Give us (in exchange) for a hundred thousand (the
opportunity to offer) this meal (to the Bhagava)."</font> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#ff00ff">"O my Princes, even if you were to give me Vesali together
with its (subject) territories, I could not give up (the opportunity to offer)
this meal."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Licchavi
princes, fluttering their fingers (in admiration), exclaimed
<font color="#0000ff">"Oh Sirs, we have been defeated by a woman! We have
been outdone by a woman!"</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Licchavi
princes went to the orchard of Ambapali. The Bhagava saw the Licchavi princes
coming, from a distance, and said to the bhikkhus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><font color="#800040"> "O Bhikkhus, let those bhikkhus who have never seen the
Tavatimsa devas<sup>1</sup>, have a good look at the gathering of the
Licchavis; let them take a long look at the assembly of the Licchavis; let the
bhikkhus gaze on them as if they were the Tavatimsa devas."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Licchavi
princes went in their carriages as far as carriages should properly proceed,
and then alighting from their carriages, went on foot to where the Bhagava was.
They made obeisance to the Bhagava and seated themselves at a suitable place. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bhagava, by his
discourse to the Licchavi princes, caused them to realize (the benefits of) the
Teaching, to become established in (the observance of) the Teaching, and to be
filled with gladness and enthusiasm for (the practice of) the Teaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Bhagava had
caused them to realize (the benefits of) the Teaching, to become established in
(the observance of) the Teaching, and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm
for (the practice of) the Teaching, the Licchavi princes said to the Bhagava,
<font color="#0000ff">"Venerable Sir, may it please the Bhagava to accept
our offering of food for tomorrow, together with the company of
bhikkhus."</font> Then the Bhagava said to them, <i><font color="#800040">" O Licchavi princes, I have already accepted the offering
of food for tomorrow by Ambapali, the courtesan."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Licchavi
princes fluttered their fingers, exclaiming<font color="#0000ff"> "Oh
Sirs, we have been defeated by a woman! We have been outdone by a woman!"
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, the
Licchavi princes, being delighted with and showing appreciation of the
Bhagava's discourse, rose from their seats, made obeisance to the Bhagava, and
departed respectfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 162. Then Ambapali,
the courtesan, after that night had passed, caused choice food and eatables of
both hard and soft kinds to be prepared in her orchard, and then informed the
Bhagava that it was time for the meal by sending the message,
<font color="#ff00ff">'Venerable Sir, it is time; the food-offering is
ready." </font>Then the Bhagava rearranged his robes suitably, and taking
alms-bowl and great robe went in the forenoon to the house of Ambapali, the
courtesan, accompanied by the company of bhikkhus, and (on arriving there) took
the seat prepared for him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Ambapali, the
courtesan, personally attended on the bhikkhus headed by the Bhagava, offering
choice hard and soft food with her own hands till the Bhagava and the bhikkhus
caused her to stop, signifying they had had enough. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Bhagava had
finished his meal and had removed his hand from his alms-bowl Ambapali, the
courtesan, took a low seat and sat down on one side. Then she said to the
Bhagava, <font color="#ff00ff">"Venerable Sir, I give this orchard in
donation to the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha."</font> The
Bhagava accepted the donation of the orchard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, after causing
Ambapali, the courtesan, by his discourse to realize (the benefits of) the
Teaching, to become established in (the observance of) the Teaching, and to be
filled with gladness and enthusiasm for (the practice of) the Teaching, the
Bhagava arose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Bhagava was
sojourning at the orchard of Ambapali, the courtesan, in Vesali, there too he
repeatedly expounded this very discourse:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><font color="#800040"> "Such is sila, morality; such is samadhi, concentration
of mind; such is panna, wisdom. Samadhi, when based upon sila, is rich in

and of great effect. The mind, when developed through panna, is thoroughly
liberated from the asavas, moral intoxicants, taints, namely, kamasava, the

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The Tavatimsa
realm is the second, in ascending order, of the six realms of the devas, the
lower celestial beings, (the Brahmas being the higher celestial beings.)</p>
