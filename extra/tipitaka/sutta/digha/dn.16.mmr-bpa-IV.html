Venerable Ananda:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font color="#800040">It may happen that
(some among) you have this thought: 'The Doctrine; (lit, the word) is bereft of
the Teacher of the Doctrine; our Teacher is no more.' But Ananda, it should not
be so considered. Ananda, the Doctrine and Discipline I have taught and laid
down to all of you will be your Teacher when I am gone. </font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font color="#800040">Ananda, when I have
passed away, bhikkhus should not address one another as they do at present by
the term <i>'avuso' </i>(Friend) (irrespective of seniority). Ananda, the
senior bhikkhus should address the junior bhikkhus by name, or by family name,
or by the term <i>'avuso'. </i>And the junior bhikkhus should address the
senior bhikkhus by the term <i>'bhante' </i>or <i>'ayasma' </i>(Venerable

Channa say whatever he wishes to. The bhikkhus should neither advise him nor
admonish him, nor deter him.</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 217. Then the Bhagava addressed the bhikkhus
thus: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font color="#800040">O Bhikkhus, if any
bhikkhu should happen to have any uncertainty or perplexity regarding the
Buddha, or the Dhamma (the Teaching), or the Samgha (the Order of bhikkhus), or
Magga, or the Practice, then, bhikkhus, ask (me) questions. Do not let
yourselves feel regret later with the thought that 'even though our Teacher was
(with us) in our very presence, we were not able to ask him questions
personally in return.'</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this was said, the bhikkhus remained
silent. For a second time, the Bhagava said ..............</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a third time, the Bhagava said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font color="#800040">O Bhikkhus, if any

Buddha, or the Dhamma, or the Samgha, or Magga, or the Practice, then,

thought that 'even though our Teacher was (with us) in our very presence, we
were not able to ask him questions personally in return.' </font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the third time, too, the bhikkhus
remained silent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Bhagava said to the bhikkhus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font color="#800040">O Bhikkhus, it may
be that you do not ask questions out of respect for the Teacher. Then,
bhikkhus, let a bhikkhu tell a companion (his uncertainty or
perplexity).</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when this was said, the bhikkhus
continued to remain silent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Venerable Ananda said to the
Bhagava:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800000">"Wonderful it is,
Venerable Sir! Marvellous it is, Venerable Sir! I believe that in this
community of bhikkhus not a single bhikkhu has uncertainty or perplexity
regarding the Buddha, or the Dhamma, or the Samgha, or Magga, or the
Practice."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font color="#800040">Ananda, you say this
only out of faith. Indeed, Ananda, the Tathagata knows for certain that in this
community of bhikkhus not a single bhikkhu has uncertainty or perplexity
regarding the Buddha, or the Dhamma, or the Samgha, or Magga, or the
Practice.</font></i></p>

<i>dukkha), </i>bound for (the three higher levels of Insight, culminating in)
Enlightenment.</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 218. Then the Bhagava said to the bhikkhus: 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><font color="#800040" size="+1"> O

fourth Jhana, the Bhagava passed away, realizing parinibbana.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 220. When the Bhagava passed away,
simultaneously with his passing away, a great, terrible, hair-raising and
gooseflesh-causing earthquake occurred. Also rolls of thunder burst forth
continuously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Bhagava passed away, at the moment
of his passing away, the Sahampati Brahma recited this verse:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000FF"> "Even such an
incomparable person as the Self-Enlightened Tathagata, the Teacher endowed with
Ten Strengths (consisting of his perfect comprehension in ten fields of
knowledge), has to pass away in this world. All beings in this world must
inevitably give up the aggregate of mental and physical phenomena."</font>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 221. When the Bhagava passed away,
immediately on his passing away, Sakka, King of the devas, recited this verse: 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000FF"> "All conditioned
and compounded things (sankhara) are indeed impermanent. Arising and decay are
inherent in them. Having come into existence, they cease. The realization of
Nibbana on their cessation is blissful peace."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 222. When the Bhagava passed away,
immediately on his passing away, the Venerable Anuruddha recited these Verses: 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000FF"> "The craving-free
Sage has passed away, intent on the peace of Nibbana. There is no more
inhalation or exhalation of breath of the Buddha, he who had a steadfast mind
and equanimity.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000FF"> "The Buddha
endured his physical suffering with an unshaken mind. Like a flame
extinguished, the mind of that Buddha has found release."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 223. When the Bhagava passed away,
immediately on his passing away, the Venerable Ananda recited this verse:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000FF"> "When the
Enlightened One, replete with all noble qualities, passed away, then at that
moment there occurred the fearsome great earthquake; then at that moment there
occurred the hair-raising, goose flesh-causing great earthquake."</font> 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 224. When the Bhagava passed away, some
bhikkhus who were at that place and who were not free from the passions wept
with upraised hands, flung themselves down, rolled forward and backward, and
rolled hither and thither, (lamenting)<font color="#0000FF"> "Too soon has
the Bhagava realized parinibbana! Too soon has the Sugata realized parinibbana!
Too soon has the Eye (i.e, the Possessor of the Eye of Wisdom) disappeared from
the world!"</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But those bhikkhus who were free from sensual
passion could bear it, mindfully and deliberately reflecting:<font color="#0000FF"> "All conditioned and compounded things <i>(sankhara)
</i>are impermanent. How then can it be possible to get that (permanence) in
this (compounded nature)?"</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 225. Then the Venerable Anuruddha said to the
bhikkhus:<font color="#FF8040"> "Enough; friends! Do not grieve, do not
lament. Had not the Bhagava proclaimed from former times that there must be
separation (while living), severance (through death) and sundering (through
being in different states of existence) from all that are dear and beloved?
Friends, in this matter, that which has the nature of arising, of appearing, of
being compounded, and of decay and dissolution, how can the wish that it should
not disintegrate and disappear be realized? There can be no such possibility.
Friends, the devas are reproachful."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF8040">"But, Venerable
Anuruddha, in what condition and in what state of mind are the
devas?"</font></p>

devas who are (standing) on the ground, taking (i.e., transforming) the earth

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Venerable Anuruddha and the
Venerable Ananda spent the rest of the night in religious discourse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 226. Then the Venerable Anuruddha said to the
Venerable Ananda, <font color="#800000">"Go, Friend Ananda, enter Kusinara
and tell the Malla princes of Kusinara, 'O Vasetthas (i.e.. Malla Princes), the
Bhagava has passed away. Do now as seems fitting to you'."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Venerable Ananda assented, saying to the
Venerable Anuruddha, <font color="#FF8040">"Very well, Venerable
Sir."</font> He then in the morning rearranged his robes, and taking
alms-bowl and great robe entered Kusinara with a companion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, the Mala princes were assembled
at the council hall on that very business (concerning the Buddha's
parinibbana). Then the Venerable Ananda went to the council hall of the
Kusinara Malla princes and said to them,<font color="#FF8040"> "O
Vasetthas, the Bhagava has passed away. Do now as seems fitting to
you."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On hearing those words of the Venerable
Ananda, the Malla princes, their sons, daughters, daughters-in-law, and their
wives felt miserably grief stricken, sad at heart and oppressively sorrowful in
mind. Some wept with dishevelled hair, with upraised hands; they flung
themselves down, and rolled forward and backward, hither and thither,
(lamenting)<font color="#0000FF"> "Too soon has the Bhagava realized
parinibbana! Too soon has the Sugata realized parinibbana! Too soon has the Eye
(i.e., the Possessor of the Eye of Wisdom) disappeared from the
world!"</font></p>

of deep mental absorption in an object of meditation, <i>samapatti </i>is a
term used for attainment of sustained deep mental absorption in an object of
meditation. When <i>Jhana </i>is sustained, it is termed <i>samapatti. </i>The
term <i>Jhana </i>is usually used for attainment in the first four stages of
deep mental absorption, i.e., the four <i>rupa jhanas. </i>The term
<i>Samapatti </i>is used for attainment in the next stages of deep mental
absorption, i. e., the four <i>arupa Jhana </i>and also for attainment of
<i>phala </i>and <i>nirodha. </i>However, the term <i>samapatti </i>is
sometimes used to denote both the <i>rupa </i>and <i>arupa Jhana. </i>In the
<i>nirodha samapatti </i>there is no object of meditation, because of the
cessation of <i>sanna</i>, Consciousness. </p>

gave orders to their men, saying <font color="#0000FF">"Gather
flower-garlands, perfumes and all kinds of musical instruments in
Kusinara."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Kusinara Malla princes, taking
flower-garlands, perfumes and all kinds of musical instruments, as well as five
hundred sets of clothing, went to where the body of the Bhagava was, in the Sal
grove of the Mallas at the road-bend. And there they passed the day in paying
homage, respect, reverence and honour to the remains of the Bhagava, with
dance, song, music, flowers and perfumes; and they made canopies of cloth and
prepared pavilions of cloth.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Kusinara Malla princes thought:
<font color="#0000FF">"It is too late today to cremate the remains of the
Bhagava; Tomorrow we shall perform the cremation."</font></p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the second day also was passed by the
Mallas in paying homage, respect, reverence and honour to the remains of the
Bhagava, with dance, song, music, flowers and perfumes, and with the erection
of canopies and pavilions of cloth. In the same way the third day also was
passed; the fourth day also was passed; the fifth day also was passed; the
sixth day also was passed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, on the seventh day, this thought
occurred to the Kusinara Malla princes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000FF"> "We shall cremate
the body of the Bhagava south of the town, carrying it to the south side beyond
the town by the Southern road outside the town, paying homage, respect,
reverence and honour to the remains of the Bhagava, with dance, song, music,
flowers and perfumes."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 228. And thereupon eight foremost elders
amongst the Malla princes, after washing their heads and donning new clothes,
tried to lift up the body of the Bhagava, (thinking) <font color="#0000FF">"We shall (now) lift up the body of the
Bhagava"</font>, but they were not able to do so. Then the Kusinara Malla
princes said to the Venerable Anuruddha, "Venerable Anuruddha, what is the
reason, what is the cause that although eight of the foremost elders amongst
the Malla princes, after washing their heads and donning new clothes, tried to
lift up the body of the Bhagava, (thinking)<font color="#0000FF"> 'We shall
(now) lift up the body of the Bhagava', they could not do so?"</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800000"> "Vasetthas, (it is
because) your intention is different from the intention of the
devas."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000FF"> "What, Venerable
Sir, is the intention of the devas?"</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Vasetthas, your intention is this: 'We
shall cremate the body of the Bhagava south of the town, carrying it to the
south side beyond the town by the southern road outside the town, paying
homage, respect, reverence and honour to the remains of the Bhagava,with
dance,song, music, flowers and perfumes.'The intention of the devas, however,
is this: 'Paying homage, respect, reverence and honour to the remains of the
Bhagavai, with celestial dance, song, music, flowers and perfumes, we shall
carry the remains of the Bhagava north of the town by the northern road, then
entering the town by the northern gate and proceeding to the centre of the town
by the central road, we shall leave by the eastern gate, and shall perform thc
cremtion ceremony at the Makutabandhana shrine<sup>1 </sup>of the Malla princes
on the east side of the town'." </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000FF"> "Venerable Sir,
let it be according to the intention of the devas,"</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;229. At that time, all of Kusinara, including
even fence-borders, rubbish heaps and dust bins, became covered knee-deep with
celestial mandarava flowers. Then the devas and the Kusinara malla princes,
paying homage, respect, reverence and honour to the remains of the Bhagava,
with both celeshal and human dance, song, music, flowers and perfumes, carried
the remains of the Bhagava north of the town by the northern road, then
entering the town by the northern gate and proceeding to the centre of the town
by the central road, they left by the eastern gate, and laid down (the bier
with) the body of the Bhagava at the Makutabandhana shrine of the Malla princes
on the east side of the town.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;230. Then the Kusinara Malla princes asked
the Venerable Ananda, <font color="#0000FF">"Venerable Ananda, what should
be done to the body of the Tathagata?"</font> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"> "O Vasetthas, the
body of the Tathagata should be treated in the same way as is done to the
remains of a Universal Monarch."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000FF"> "Venerable Ananda,
what is done to the remains of a Universal Monarch?"</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF8040"> <font color="#800040">"O Vasetthas, the body of a Universal Monarch is wrapped
up in new cloth. After being wrapped up in new cloth, (the body is) wrapped up
in carded cotton wool. After being wrapped up in carded cotton wool, (it is)
again wrapped up in new cloth. In this way the body of the Universal Monarch is
wrapped up in five hundred successive layers (of cloth and cotton wool). Then
it is enclosed in a golden oil vat and covered over by another golden vat. Then
a pyre of all kinds of perfumed wood is built, and the body of the Universal
Monarch is cremated. A stupa (i.e., a monumental mound with a dome), to (the
honour of) the Universal Monarch is built at the junction of four highways. O
Vasetthas, this is what is done to the body of a Universal
Monarch."</font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF8040"> <font color="#800040">"O Vasetthas, in the same way as is done to the body of a
Universal Monarch, so should it be done to the body of the Tathagata. A stupa
to (the honour of) the Tathagata should be built at the junction of four
highways. At that stupa people will make offerings of flowers or incense or
scented powder, or will pay homage, or will feel reverence in their minds. To
such people, benefit and happiness will accrue for a long
time."</font></font> </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Kusinara Malla princes gave orders
to their men, to collect (all) the carded cotton wool of the Malla princes.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Kusinara Malla princes wrapped up
the body of the Bhagava in new cloth. After being wrapped up in new cloth, (the
body was) wrapped up in carded cotton wool. After being wrapped up in carded

of the Bhagava was placed on the pyre.</p>

<td> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 231. Now at that time the Venerable
Mahakassapa was on the way from Pava to Kusinara together with a large company
of bhikkhus, numbering five hundred. Then the Venerable Mahakassapa left the
road and sit down at the foot of a tree. At that time a certain Ajivaka, (who
was a naked ascetic), was journeying towards Pava, taking (with him) a
mandarava flower from Kusinara. Now the Venerable Mahakassapa saw that Ajivaka
coming from a distance and seeing him said to that Ajivaka,
<font color="#800000">"Friend, do you know our Teacher ?"</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000FF"> "Yes, friend, I
know of him. It is seven days now since the Samana Gotama passed away. (In
fact,) I have brought this celestial mandarava flower from there (i.e., from
the place where the Buddha passed away)."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Thereupon), some of the bhikkhus who were
not (yet) free from tne passions, from amongst the five hundred bhikkhus with
the Venerable Mahakassapa, wept with upraised hands, flung themselves down,
rolled forward and backward, and rolled hither and thither, (lamenting)
<font color="#FF8040">'Too soon has the Bhagava realized parinibbana! Too soon
has the Sugata realized parinibbana! Too soon has the Eye (i.e., the Possessor
of the Eye of Wisdom) disappeared from the world!"</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But those bhikkhus who were free from sensual
passion could bear it, mindfully and deliberately reflect ing:
<font color="#BA5901">"All conditioned and compounded things are
impermanent. How then can it be possible to get that (permanence) in this
(compounded nature) ?"</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 232. Now at that time Subhadda <sup>1
</sup>who had become a bhikkhu only in old age was amongst that assembly. And
that Subhadda who had become a bhikkhu in his old age said thus to the (other)
bhikkhus: <font color="#FF00FF">"Enough, friends. Do not grieve, do not
lament. We are well rid of that great Samana. He had oppressed us by (saying)
'This is proper for you; that is not proper for you'. But now we shall do what
we like; we shall not do what we do not like."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Venerable Mahakassapa said to the
bhikkhus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800000"> "Enough, Avuso; do
not grieve, do not lament. Had not the Bhagava expounded from long before the
(inevitable) facts of separation (while living), severance (through death), and
sundering (through being in different states of existence) from all that are
dear and beloved? Avuso, in this matter, that which has the nature of arising,
of appearing, of being compounded, and of decay and dissolution, how can the
wish that it, even the body of the Tathagata, should not disintegrate and
disappear be realized? Did not the Bhagava expound from long before that there
can be no such possibility?" </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 233. Now at that time four foremost Malla
princes, after washing their heads and donning new clothes, (thought) "We
will set fire to the Bhagava's funeral pyre," (and tried to ignite it) but
were not able to do so. Then the Kusinara Malla princes asked the Venerable
Anuruddna thus: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#8000FF">"Venerable
Anuruddha, what is the reason, what is the cause that although four foremost
Malla princes, after washing their heads and donning new clothes, tried to
kindle the funeral pyre of the Bhagava, they were not able to set it on fire
?"</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"> "O Vasetthas, the
wish (lit., the intention) of the devas is different."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#8000FF"> "Venerable Sir,
what is the wish of the devas ?"</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"> "O Vasetthas has,
the wish of the devas is this: The Venerable Mahakassapa is journeying along
the way from Pava to Kusinara, with a great company of bhikkhus, numbering five
hundred; let not the Bhagava's funeral pyre catch fire until the Venerable
Mahakassapa has paid homage with his head at the feet of the
Bhagava."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#8000FF">"Venerable Sir,
let it be according to the wish of the devas." </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 234. Then the Venerable Mahakassapa came to
the funeral pyre of the Bhagava at the Makutabandhana shrine of the Malla
princes in Kusinara. When he had come up to it, he arranged his robe over one
shoulder and under the other, and with the palms of his hands put together and
lifted up in reverence he walked three times round the pyre with his right side
to it, and paid homage with his head against the feet of the Bhagava. The five
hundred bhikkhus also (who had come with the Venerable Mahakassapa) arranged
their robes over one shoulder and under the other, and with their palms put
together and lifted up in reverence, they walked three times round the pyre
with their right side to it, and paid homage with their heads against the fect
of the Bhagava. When the Venerable Mahakassapa and the five hundred bhikkhus
had paid their homage, the funeral pyre of the Bhagava spontaneously burst into
flames. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 235. From the outer tegument (thin skin), or
tho corium (thick under-skin) or the flesh, or the sinews <sup>2</sup>, or the
synovic<sup>3</sup> fluid of the body of the Bhagava which was burnt away,
neither ash nor soot <sup>4</sup>was to bo seen. Only the
bone-relics<sup>5</sup> remained. Just as, for instance, when butter or oil is
burnt away, neither ash nor soot is to be seen, so from the outer tegument, or
the corium, or the flesh, or the sinews, or the synovic fluid of the body of
the Bhagava which was burnt away, neither ash nor soot was to be seen. Only the
bone-relics remained. Of those five hundred sets of cloth wrappings, only two
were not consumed by fire, the innermost and the outermost. When the body of
the Bhagava had been burnt up, a stream of water appeared from the sky and
extinguished the pyre. A stream of water also spurted out from those Sal trees
which had water in them and extinguished the pyre of the Bhagava. The Kusinara
Malla princes, too, extinguished the pyre with water scented with all kinds of
perfumes. Then the Kusinara Malla princes surrounded the bone-relics of the
Bhagava (placed) in the council hall with a cordon of spearmen and
bowmen<sup>6</sup>, and for an entire seven days paid homage, respect,
reverence and honour to the relics with dance, song, music and perfumes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One eye-tooth<sup>3 </sup>is revered
and honoured by the Tavatimsa devas. One eye-tooth is revered and honoured in
Gandhara. One eye-tooth is revered and honoured in the realm of the King of
Kalinga. One eye-tooth is revered and honoured by the king of the Nagas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Through their glorious power, this
earth is adorned with (festivals of) reverence and honour to the noble relics.
Thus these relics of the Possessor of the Eye of Wisdom are reverentially
honoured by the worthiest devas and men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Lords of devas, lords of Nagas and lords of
men revere and honour the relics. In the same way the highest monarchs revere
and honour the relics. If those (relics)are obtained, pay homage with palms(of
hands) put together and lifted up in reverence. Indeed, through hundreds of
aeons, it is extremely difficult to meet a Buddha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devas have taken the forty
evenly-shaped teeth, all the hair and the hairs of the body, each separately,
to all universes in succession.</p>

miraculous powers and great strength.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. eye-tooth: datha: one of the four
sharp-pointed teeth, one on each side of the upper and lower jaws, between the
incisors (cutting teeth) and the molars (grinders). The term
"eye-teeth" would strictly refer to the two in the upper jaw only,
but is used here for all the four teeth, for convenience.</p>
