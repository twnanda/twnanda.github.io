the Bhagava was staying at the Jetavana monastery of Anathapindika in Savatthi.
During that time, soon after the middle watch of the night, many devas of
exceeding beauty, who become devas by (practising and) imparting the doctrine
of the virtuous, approached the Bhagava, illuminating the entire Jetavana
monastery. They made their obeisance to the Bhagava and stood at a suitable
place. Having stood thus, one of them spoke thus in verse in the presence of
the Bhagava:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Due
either to stinginess or to remissness,<SUP>1</SUP> one fails to give in
charity.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One who
wishes to do good and who understands the merit of good deeds should give in
charity.&quot; </FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another <I>deva
</I>spoke this verse in the presence of the Bhagava. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The
stingy person, being afraid (of loss of property), does not give, and the very
thing he fears befalls him. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
stingy person fears he might go hungry or thirsty; and the very things he fears
beset the fool both in this world and in the hereafter.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore,
removing stinginess and overcoming its uncleanness, one should give in charity.
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good
deeds stand one in good stead in the future worlds.&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another <I>deva

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Like
fellow-travellers sharing (the rations) with one another on a journey, certain
travellers in <I>samsara's </I>long journey share whatever little they have
with other fellow-travellers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are
the ones who do not die among those others who are dead.<SUP>2 </SUP>This is a
time-honourd tradition.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Some,
though they have very little, share with others.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(On the
other hand,) some, even though well-off, do not give in charity.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gift
made out of slender means is worth a thousand (gifts).&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another <I>deva
</I>spoke this verse in the presence of the Bhagava:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Giving
what is difficult to give, or doing what is difficult to do, is something that
the wicked could not imitate.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Indeed,)
the practice of the virtuous is difficult to follow.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore,
the virtuous and the wicked have different destinations when they pass away
from this existence.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
wicked reach the niraya realms of continuous suffering, the virtuous reach the
deva realms. </FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another <I>deva
</I>spoke thus to the Bhagava:&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Bhagava, whose words are well-spoken?&quot;</FONT> </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(and the Bhagava
said:) <I><FONT COLOR="#800040">Each of these statements is well-spoken in its
own way. However, listen to mine also:</FONT></I></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT

performs meritorious acts.</I></FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another <I>deva

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Why is this great and extensive alms-giving less in value
than the offering made righteously? Why is the merit gained by a hundred

merit gained by the poor man?&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The Bhagava said:) 
</P>
<P><FONT
COLOR="#800040"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Some
people are steeped in unrighteousness; they give in charity only after striking
or killing or causing others' sorrow.</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT
COLOR="#800040"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
offerings which involve tearful faces and coercion can never equal the
righteous gift. Thus the merit gained by a hundred thousand donors donating a
thousand each is not worth even a hundredth of the merits gained by the poor
man.&quot;<SUP>3</SUP></I></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="+1">Foot Notes on Macchari Sutta</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Due either to
stinginess or to remissness:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The practice of
giving as a volitional act is not easy to come about. When the possessor of any
object worth giving is stingy he is loathe to part with it. Or again, he may
forget about the good practice of giving if he is pleased with him self and his
own petty engagements.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. They are the ones
who do not die among those others who are dead:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The niggardly ones
are dead to the needs of others around them; their insensitivity puts them in
the same class as the dead. In another sense, just as a dead person is unable
to speak out, 'This is for so and so, etc.&quot;, a niggardly person has the
same inability. So he is as good as dead. The one who likes to give whatever
little at his disposal therefore is the one who is alive among those others
who, though living, are as good as dead.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The means of
acquiring the property that is donated is the criterion. The extent of the
merit depends on the purity or otherwise of the means by which the donated
property was acquired.</P>
