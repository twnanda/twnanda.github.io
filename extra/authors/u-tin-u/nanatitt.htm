</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time the Bhagava was
residing near Rajagaha at the Veluvana Grove where black squirrels were fed.
During that time, soon after the middle watch of the night, the devas Asama,
Sahali, Nika, Akotaka, Vegabbhari, Manavagamiya, who were followers of the
teachers of many and various other faiths<SUP>1</SUP> and who were of extremely
attractive appearance, approached the Bhagava, illuminating the entire Veluvana
Grove. Having made obeisance to the Bhagava, uttered this verse in the presence
of the Bhagava, with reference to <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Purana
Kassapa:</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In this
world (Purana) Kassapa does not view mutilation, killing, injuring or depriving
other of properties either as evil or good done by oneself.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He (thus) sets
forth a refuge (for people)<SUP>2</SUP>. Indeed, our Teacher is worthy of
honour.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, the deva
Sahali uttered this verse in the presence of the Bhagava with reference to
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Makkhali Gosala</FONT>: -</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Through
self-mortification and abhorence (of evil), he (Makkhali) has his mind well
under control. Keeping away from controversy with people, he refrains from
untruth and is always truthful. In fact, he never commits such acts of
evil.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the deva
Nika, uttered this verse in the presence of the bhagava with reference to<FONT
COLOR="#0000FF"> Nigantha Nataputta:</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The bhikkhu
(Nataputta) abhors evil and is endowed with mature wisdom. He is disciplined in
four degrees of self-restraint<SUP>3</SUP>. He reveals what is seen or heard.
Indeed, he is past wrong-doing.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the deva
Akotaka, uttered this verse in the presence of Bhagava with reference to the
various teachers of other faiths: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Pakudha
Kaccayana, Nigantha (Nataputta), Makkhali (Gosala), and Purana(Kassapa)-all of
these teachers of various sects have attained the height of holiness.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, they all are not far from the
virtuous (i.e., they are not different from the virtuous).&quot;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the deva Vegabbhari retorted
against the deva Akotaka, by the following stanza:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just by going about together
with the lion the despicable dark jackal cannot in the least be the equal of
the lion.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those teachers of various sects
practise nudity, speak falsehood and follow dubious practices.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No resemblance is there between them
and the virtuous!&quot;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the wicked Mara possessed
Vegabbhari and uttered this verse in the presence of the Bhagava:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Those teachers strive earnestly
in practising self-mortification through abhorence (of evil). They safeguard
themselves against defilements<SUP>4</SUP>. They are enamoured of sensual
objects such as attractive visual objects and they long for the delights of
deva world (which they believe can be obtained by such abstinences here and
now). Indeed they admonished others to endeavour to reach a better future
existence.&quot;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Bhagava knew that it was the
wicked Mara who was actually saying that and replied to him in the following
verse:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Whatever
attractive visual objects there are in this world or in the celestial world,
and whatever brilliantly shining objects there are in the sky, all those
objects praised by you, Namuci, are in fact like fish-bait cast (into water)
for the killing of fish.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the deva
Manavagamiya uttered this verse with reference to the Bhagava.<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Vipula is
said to be the foremost among the mountains that surround Rajagaha; the White
Mountain (Kelasa), is the foremost among the mountains of the Himalayas; the
Sun is the foremost among all planets that roam the sky.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Among all expanses of water
the ocean stands foremost; among all the planets of the zodiac the Moon stands
foremost.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And among all living beings in all
the worlds including the celestial world, the Buddha is called
supreme.&quot;<BR>
<BR>

<HR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Followers of
the teachers of many and various other faiths: Except for the deva
Manavagamiya, the devas who come and utter praises for the teachers of other
faiths were in their former births followers of the various great teachers who
declared themselves as Buddhas. In spite of being followers of Purana Kassapa
etc., these devas had been believers in kamma and performers of good deeds, as
a result of which they were reborn in the deva world. In their ignorance of the
truth, they believe that they owe their fortunate destination in the deva world
to their confidence in those religious teachers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A refuge (for
people): what is implied here is that such a view sets people's minds at ease. 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Four degrees of self-restraint:
A nigantha abstains from using any cold water. He abstains from all evil; he
shakes off all evil, and by utmost abstinence he attains perfection.</P>
<P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Against defilement: In the
Pali Text, palayanpavivekan, lit., safeguarding seclusion (from defilements).
