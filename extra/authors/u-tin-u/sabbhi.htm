<TD><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31. Thus have I
heard:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time the
Bhagava was staying at the Jetavana monastery of Anathapindika in Savatthi.
During that time soon after 'the middle watch of the night, many devas of
exceeding beauty, who became devas<SUP>1</SUP> by (practising and) imparting
the doctrine of the virtuous,<SUP>2 </SUP>approached the Bhagava, illuminating
the entire Jetavana monastery. They made their obeisance to the Bhagava and
stood at a suitable place. Having stood thus, one of them spoke thus in verse
in the presence of the Bhagava:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;One should associate only with the virtuous; one should
make friends with the virtuous, knowing the moral principles from the virtuous,
one becomes nobler, and is not base.&quot;</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then another deva
spoke this verse in the presence of the Bhagava: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;One should associate only with the virtuous; and should
make friends with the virtuous; knowing the moral principles from the virtuous,
one gains knowledge from them, and not from others (i.e. fools).&quot;</FONT>
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then another deva
spoke this verse in the presence of the Bhagava:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT
COLOR="#0000FF"> &quot;One should associate only with the virtuous; one should
make friends with the virtuous; knowing the moral principles from the virtuous,
one does not grieve amidst the grief-stricken people.&quot; </FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another <I>deva
</I>spoke this verse in the presence of the Bhagava;. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;One should associate only with the virtuous; one should
make friends with the virtuous; knowing the moral principles from the virtuous,
one shines forth among one's kinsmen.&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then another <I>deva
</I>spoke this verse in the presence of the Bhagava:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;One should associate only with the virtuous: one should
make friends with the virtuous; knowing the, moral principles from the
virtuous, beings get reborn in the fortunate planes of existence.&quot; </FONT>
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another deva
spoke this verse in the presence of the Bhagava:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;One should associate only with the virtuous; one should
make friends with the virtuous; knowing the moral principles from the virtuous,
beings remain in a happy state for long.&quot; </FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another deva said
to the Bhagava thus:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Bhagava, whose words are well-spoken?&quot; </FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And the Bhagava
said:)</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I><FONT
COLOR="#800040">&quot;Each of those statements well-spoken in its own way.
However, listen to mine also: One should associate only with the virtuous; one
should seek the guidance of the virtuous; knowing the moral principles from the
virtuous, one gets free from all dukkha.&quot;</FONT></I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So said the Bhagava.
The devas were delighted. After paying obeisance and showing respect to the
Bhagava, they vanished then and there.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. This discourse
derives from the following story:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The devas recited
verses in praise of their teacher who exhorted them to practise the doctrine of
the virtuous just before their death. They had been seafaring traders, seven
hundred of them all, in their previous existence. They met with violent storms
at sea. Death by shipwreck was imminent. They wailed and prayed to the devas
for their lives. But one of them remained calm; he sat squatting, reflecting on
the purity of his faith in the Three Jewels and of the five moral precepts. His
comrades asked him why he was so calm and composed. He told them about the
doctrine of the virtuous in which he had taken refuge. They asked him to share
the good doctrine with them. He was only too glad to do so. He divided them
into seven groups of a hundred each and, administering the five precepts,
exhorted them to reflect on their observance of the precepts, for that was the
doctrine of the virtuous that would save them, and there was nothing else that
they could lean on. The seven hundred sailor merchants met a watery grave but
because of their observance of the doctrine of the virtuous just before their
death they were reborn in the Realm of the Thirty three (Tavatimsa) devas.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. the doctrine of
the virtuous: It is a generic term for a wide range of moral or virtuous
practices including the five precepts, the ten precepts, the four bases of
mindfulness, the four right endeavours etc., but here the five precepts are
meant. </P>
