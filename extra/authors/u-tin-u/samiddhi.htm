<TD> <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. Thus have I heard: </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time the Bhagava was residing at
the Tapoda monastery in Rajagaha. During that time at the break of dawn one day
the Venerable Samiddhi rose and went to the river Tapoda to bathe. Having had
his bath there, he climbed out and stood wearing only a single robe to let the
water on his body dry. At that pleasant time a ceratin female deva of exceeding
beauty approached the bhikkhu illuminating the entire Tapoda river; then,
standing in mid-air, she spoke to the Venerable Samiddhi in verse:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> &quot;Bhikkhu!
Without enjoying sense-pleasures, you go round for alms-food.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't go round for alms-food without
enjoying sense-pleasures.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhikkhu, you should go round for alms-food
(only) after having enjoyed sense pleasures.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't let the opportune time pass you
by.&quot;</FONT></I></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;O deva! I do
not know the time when I shall die. That time being hidden is not apparent to
me.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being so, I go round for alms-food
without enjoying sense-pleasures.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot let the opportune time pass me
by.&quot;<SUP>1</SUP></FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereupon. the female deva, standing on
the ground, spoke thus to the Venerable Samiddhi: <I><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;O bhikkhu! you became a bhikkhu quite young. Though you
are a mere lad with luxuriant dark hair in the prime of youth and in the first
period of life, you have not yet enjoyed sense-pleasures. Bhikkhu, do enjoy
human pleasures (first). Don't yearn for future pleasures (of the deva world)
forsaking present pleasures.</FONT></I><SUP>2</SUP>&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;Friend! As
a matter of fact, I am not yearning for future pleasures by forsaking present
pleasures. Indeed, friend, rejecting future pleasures also, I seek the
Lokuttara Dhamma<SUP>3 </SUP> which can be personally realized here and
now.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#800000">Friend, indeed
the Bhagava has said: future pleasures (of the deva world) are full of woes,
full of miseries; these (sense pleasures) are full of faults. This Lokuttara
Dhamma is personally apperceivable here and now; it is not delayed in its
results; it can stand investigation; it is worthy of being perpetually borne in
mind: and its truths can be realized and experienced by the Ariyas individually
by their own effort and practice.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;O
bhikkhu! How has the Bhagava pointed out that the future pleasures (of the deva
world) are full of woe and full of misery?</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what way
are these (sense-pleasures) full of faults? How is this Lokuttara Dhamma
personally appreciable here and now?</I> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is it not
delayed in its results?</I> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can it
stand investigation?</I> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is it
worthy of being perpetually borne in mind? And how can its truths be realised
and experienced by the Ariyas individually by their own effort and
practice?&quot;</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Friend! I
am a newcomer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not been
long in this bhikkhuhood.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have come under
this Teaching<SUP>4 </SUP>only recently. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not capable
of explaining that Teaching at length. There is the Homage-Worthy and the
Perfectly Self-Enlightened Bhagava, now residing at the Tapoda monastery in
Rajagaha. Go to the Bhagava, ask him about this matter, and bear in mind what
the Bhagava says.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;O
bhikkhu! The Bhagava is surrounded by other devas who are much more powerful
than myself and it would not be easy for me to get near the Bhagava. Bhikkhu,
if you were to approach the Bhagava and were to ask him about this matter, we
also would come to listen to the dhamma.&quot;</I></FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;Very well,
friend&quot;</FONT>, replied the Venerable Samiddhi to that deva and went to
where the Bhagava was staying. Once there, he made obeisance to the Bhagava and
sat at a suitable place. Having seated himself, he said to the Bhagava thus: 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;Venerable
Sir, here in this city of Rajagaha, at the break of dawn one day, I rose and
went to the river Tapoda to bathe. Having had my bath there, I climbed out and
stood wearing only a single robe to let the water on my body dry. At that
pleasant time a certain female deva of exceeding beauty approached me,
illuminating the entire Tapoda river. There, standing in mid air she spoke to
me in verse:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O bhikkhu,
without enjoying sense-pleasures you go round for alms-food.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't go round for alms-food without
enjoying sense-pleasures.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't let the opportune time pass you
by.&quot;</FONT></P>
<FONT COLOR="#800000"> </FONT><P><FONT
COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Venerable Sir, when this
was said I replied to that deva in verse:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (O deva,) I do not know the time (when I
shall die);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That time, being hidden, is not apparent
to me.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That being so, I go round for alms-food,
without enjoying sense-pleasures.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot let the opportune time pass me
by.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Then,
Venerable Sir, the female deva, standing on the ground, spoke this to me: O
Bhikkhu, you became a bhikkhu quite young; though you are a mere lad with
luxuriant dark hair in the prime of youth, and in the first period of life, you
have not yet enjoyed sense-pleasures. Bhikkhu, do enjoy human pleasures
(first); don't yearn for future pleasures (of the deva world ) forsaking
present pleasures!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When this
was said, Venerable Sir, I replied to that female deva thus: Friend! As a
matter of fact. I am not yearning for future pleasures by forsaking the present
pleasures. Indeed ,friend, rejecting future pleasures also, I seek the
Lokuttara Dhamma which can be personally realised here and now. Friend! Indeed
the Bhagava has said future pleasures (of the deva world) are full of woe, full
of misery. These (sense-pleasures) are full of faults. This Lokuttara Dhamma is
apperceivable here and now; it is not delayed in its results; it can stand
investigation; it is worthy of being perpetually borne in mind; and its truths
can be realised and experienced by the Ariyas individually by their own effort
and practice.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Then,
Venerable Sir, that deva said to me: ' O Bhikkhu! How has the Bhagava pointed
out that the future pleasures (of the deva world) are full of woe and full of
misery? In what way are these (sense-pleasures) full of faults? How is this
Lokuttara Dhamma person ally apperceivable here and now? How is it not delayed
in its results? How can it stand investigation? How is it worthy of being
perpetually borne in mind? And how can its truths be realized and experienced
by the Ariyas individually by their own effort and practice?&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And when
this was said Venerable Sir, I told her:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Friend! I am a
newcomer; I have not been long in this bhikkhuhood. I have come under this
Teaching only recently. I am not capable of explaining that Teaching at length.
There is the Homage-Worthy, the Perfectly Self Enlightened Bhagava, now
residing at the Tapoda monastery in Rajagaha. Go to the Bhagava, ask him about
this matter, and bear in mind what the Bhagava says.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Thereupon,
Venerable Sir, the deva said to me: 'O Bhikkhu! the Bhagava is surrounded by
other devas who are more powerful than myself and it would not be easy for me
to get near the Bhagava. Bhikkhu, if you were to approach the Bhagava and were
to ask him about this matter, we also would come to listen to the
dhamma.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Venerable
Sir, if that female deva spoke the truth she should be around now.&quot;</FONT>
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this was said, the female deva
said to the Venerable Samiddhi: <I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot; Bhikkhu, ask!
Bhikkhu, ask! I have arrived&quot;.</FONT></I></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Bhagava spoke to that deva in
verse:</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#800040">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The
beings who perceive the complex of the mental and physical aggregates as
individual entities (such as man, woman, animal) are firmly rooted (through
attachment, etc.) in the concept of the five aggregates as individual entities
and, not accurately understandings the five khandha aggregates, fall a prey to
death. He who accurately understands the five khandha aggregates does not see
any object which can be spoken of as an individual entity. It is because in him
there is no reason (such as attachment) to speak of any individual entity.
&quot;If you know such a person in whom defilements are extinct (i.e., an
arahat), deva, say it.&quot;</FONT></I></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Venerable Sir, what the Bhagava has said in brief I do not understand the
meaning in full. Venerable Sir,</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I beg of you
to expound the dhamma so that I might understand the meaning in full of what
the Bhagava has said in brief.&quot;</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He who considers
himself as either equal to, or superior to, or inferior to some other person
may dispute with any person on that ground.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To one who is not
troubled by those three conceits, there do not occur the notions of being equal
to, or superior to, or inferior to anyone.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you know such
a person in whom the defilements are extinct (i.e., arahat), deva, say
it.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Venerable Sir, in this also what the Bhagava has said in
brief I do not understand the meaning in full. Venerable Sir, I beg of you to
expound the dhamma so that I might understand the meaning in full of what the
Bhagava has said in brief.&quot;</FONT></I></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;One who
can no longer be called a person with attachment, a person with hatred, a
person with bewilderment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one who is
without conceit, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one who has cut
off craving for this mind-matter complex, one who has cut off the (four) bonds,
one who is free form suffering and is without longing---,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rebirth of
such a one (after death and dissolution), when searched for by devas or human
beings, cannot be found in this world or in another world or in the world of
devas or in any abode of existence.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If you know
such a person in whom the defilements are extinct (i.e., an arahat)<SUP>6
</SUP>deva, say it.&quot; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Venerable Sir, what the Bhagava has said in brief, I understand fully in
this way:</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Throughout the world no evil whatsoever, bodily, verbally or mentally,
should be committed.</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One should at
all times be mindful;</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with
mindfulness and clear comprehension one should avoid indulgence in
sense-pleasures; (and also)</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one should not
resort to practices of self-mortification which are of no
benefit.<SUP>7</SUP>&quot;</I></FONT></P>
<HR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> . I cannot let the
opportune time pass me by: By the opportune time is meant the best time for
engaging in the practice of a bhikkhu, since youth is the best part of one's
life to practise for Insight-Knowledge.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> . present pleasures:
sanditthika: The celestial maiden uses the term sanditthika to refer to sense
pleasures of the human world in the present life time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>3</SUP> . Lokuttara Dhamma which
can be personally realised here and now: the term sanditthika is here used to
indicate the lokuttara dhamma which can be personally realized here and now.
This Lokuttara Dhamma is the dhamma of Magga, Phala and Nibbana.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>4</SUP> . Teaching: dhammavinaya:
lit., Doctrine and Discipline, also rendered Sasana.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>5</SUP>. Accurately understanding:
parinna: </P>
<UL>
<LI>(i) Understanding of the distinction between mind and matter and their
features, essential properties, resulting phenomena and proximate causes is
accurate understanding of what should be known (nata parinna). </LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>(ii) Understanding the true characteristics of mind and matter that they
are transient, unsatisfactory and woeful, and lacking in substantiality, is
accurate understanding through scrutiny (tirana-parinna) </LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>(iii) Abandoning all craving for the five aggregates is accurate
understanding through abandonment (pahana parinna). In this context the
abandonment is absolute, i.e., it is by Arahatta Magga. </LI>
</UL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>6</SUP>. This is an expansion
according to the Commentary of the terse phrase in the Pali text 'It you know'
sace vijanasi.' The Commentary also explains that knowing what an arahat is
amounts to knowledge of the Lokuttara Dhamma, the Supramundane dhamma, i.e.,
Magga, Phala, Nibbana.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>7</SUP>. The last stanza indicates
that the deva has attained sotapatti magga.</P>
