Discourse Concerning the Censorious Devas</FONT></P>

<TD> <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35. At one time the
Bhagava was staying at the Jetavana monastery of Anathapindika in Savatthi.
During that time, soon after the middle watch of the night, many censorious
devas<SUP>1</SUP> of exceeding beauty approached the Bhagava, illuminating the
entire Jetavana monastery. Having made their approach they stood in mid-air.
Standing in mid-air, one of them spoke this verse in the presence of the
Bhagava:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What a certain person
says is different from what he himself is;<SUP>2</SUP> what that person enjoys
amounts to theft (of the four requisites). </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like a bird-catcher
who makes a living by means of trickery.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One should speak only
of what one actually does, and should not speak of what one does not actually
do.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wise can see through a
person who speaks of what he himself does not do.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The Bhagava said:)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That practice<SUP>3
</SUP>which is firm 'has been adopted by wise persons who have thereby burnt
out all defilements in them and have escaped from the bonds of Mara.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to engage
in that Practice by merely speaking or hearing about it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the wise who know
the real nature of the world do not act thus.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wise who know the' 'Four
Ariya Truths and who in the world have transcended Craving have extinguished
defilements.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon the <I>devas
</I>stood on the ground and, placing their heads at the Bhagava's feet,
addressed him thus: &quot;Venerable Sir, being foolish, being bewildered, and
being unwise, we have committed a great wrong.<SUP>4 </SUP>We thought that we
could assail the Bhagava We re quest the Bhagava to accept our offence as
offence so that we may restrain ourselves in the future.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Bhagava~
smiled.<SUP>5</SUP></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon the devas became
extremely censorious<SUP>6 </SUP>and ascended to the sky from where one of them
spoke thus in verse in the presence of the Bhagava.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One who does not
accept the admission of offence by others has anger in his heart and is giving
undue weight to the offence; he is tied up in knots of enmity.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The Bhagava said:)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If there were no
transgression</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there would be in the world
no offence.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no end to
enmity, how could there be in the world a faultless man?&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The deva said:)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who is the one who
does not trangress?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is the one who does not
commit any offence? Who is one who is not bewildered?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who is the wise one</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is mindful all the
time?&quot; (The Bhagava said:)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Buddha who is a
Tathagata who has compassion on all sentient beings, does not transgress, does
not commit any offence, is never bewildered, and is the wise one who is mindful
all the time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One who does not accept the
admission of offence by others has anger in his heart and is giving undue
weight to the offence; he is tied up in knots of enmity: I do not like that
enmity. I accept the admission of your offence.&quot;</P>

<HR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. censorious devas:
ujjhanasannika devas:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devas who addressed the
Buddha here were prejudiced against the Buddha. They assumed that the Buddha
did not practise what he preached. To them, the Buddha extolled austerity and
contentment but lived in luxury. His day was spent in preaching only. This
censonous attitude was so strong in this particular body of devas that the
theras who convened the First Buddhist Council gave the epithet' censorious -
minded' to them. The term does not signify a separate celestial abode.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. What a certain person
says is different from what he himself is. The accusation in these words is
actually aimed at the Buddha himself. It implies that the Buddha is being
hypocritical.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. 'That practice' means the
practice of the Ariya Path of Eight Constituents which is a sure way to attain
Magga and Phala (fruition) in four stages and Nibbana.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The devas admitted that
they had transgressed against the Buddha; their staying in mid-air with the
Buddha below them was bodily transgression: their false accusation was verbal
transgression.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Then the Bhagava smiled: 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddhas smile by just a
slight gesture of baring the tips of the front teeth. The smile prompted the
devas to ask a further question which enabled the Buddha to express his
forbearance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. the devas became
extremely censorious because they misunderstood the reason for the Buddha's
smile.</P>
