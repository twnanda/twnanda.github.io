Discourse on Non-existence of permanent Sense-objects</FONT></P>

<TD> <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. At one time the
Bhagava was staying at the Jetavana monastery of Anathapindika in Savatthi.
During that time, soon after the middle watch of the night, many devas of
exceeding beauty, who became devas by (practising and) imparting the doctrine
of the virtuous, approached the Bhagava, illuminating the entire Jetavana
monastery. They made their obeisance to the Bhagava and stood at a suitable
place. Having stood thus, one of them spoke thus in verse in the presence of
the Bhagava:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Among people there do
not exist permanent sense pleasures.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world there are
desirable sense-objects. The man who is bound by them, and who is intoxicated
by them, cannot proceed from the thirty-one planes of existences which are the
domain of death to Nibbana.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The Bhagava said:)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Due to Craving, the
mental and physical aggregates come about;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;due to craving, dukkha comes
about. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Craving is removed,
there will be no mental and physical aggregates. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mental and physical
aggregates disappear, there will be no dukkha. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the world it is not
just the various pleasant things that can be called sense-pleasures. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact the craving that
arises from a man's thinking is also sense-pleasure.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world these various
pleasant things exist by themselves.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;however, the wise remove any
craving for them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dukkha does not fall
on one who gives up anger, who gives up conceit, who overcomes all fetters, who
is not attached to the complex of mental and physical phenomena and who is
unperturbed.<SUP>2</SUP></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One who can no longer be
called a person with attachment, a person with hatred, a person with
bewilderment, one who is without conceit, one who has cut off craving for this
mind-matter complexs, one who has cut off the (four) bonds, one who is free
from suffering and is without longing, --- the rebirth of such a one (after
death and dissolution) when searched for by devas or human beings can not be
found in this world, or in another world, or in the world of devas, or in any
abode of existence.<SUP>3</SUP>&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The Venerable Mogharaja
asked thus:)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If that person who is
liberated (from defilements) cannot be found by devas and human beings in this
world or any other world, should those who worship such a person who excells
mankind and who conducts himself for the benefit of mankind be praised?&quot; 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The Bhagava said:)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bhikkhu (Mogharaja),
those who worship such a liberated one (i.e., an arahat) deserve praise.
Bhikkhu, those worshippers too, comprehending the Four Ariya Truths, and
removing doubt, can escape the craving that cleaves.&quot;</P>
