<TD> <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38. Thus have I heard: 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time the Bhagava was
residing in Maddakucchi<SUP>1 </SUP> Park, a deer sanctuary near Rajagaha. At
that time the Bhagava's foot was struck by a splinter of rock.<SUP>2 </SUP>The
Bhagava felt excessive physical pain which was tormenting, acute, harsh,
severe, nasty and unpleasant. Not complaining at, all the Bhagava endured the
pain with mindfulness and comprehension. He lay on his right side on the great
robe which was spread on the ground folded fourfold, with one foot slightly
further than the other one on which it rested. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During that time, soon after
the middle watch of the night, seven hundred devas of exceeding beauty who
became devas by (practising and) imparting the doctrine of the virtuous,
approached the Bhagava, illuminating the entire Maddakucchi Park. They made
obeisance to the Bhagava and stood at a suitable place. And standing thus, one
of them uttered this expression of joy in the presence of the Bhagava:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends! How like the
powerful elephant is Samana Gotama' It is because he is like the powerful
elephant that he is not complaining at all but is enduring with mindfulness and
comprehension this physical pain which is tormenting, acute, harsh, severe,
nasty and unpleasant!&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another deva uttered
this' expression of joy in the presence of the Bhagava:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Friends&quot; How like
the brave lion is Samana Gotama! It is because he is like the brave lion that
he is not complaining at all, but is enduring with mindfulness and
comprehension this physical pain which is tormenting, acute, harsh, severe,
nasty and unpleasant!&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another deva uttered
this expression of joy in the presence of the Bhagava:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Friends! How like a
hero is Samana Gotama! It is because he is like a hero that he is not
complaining at all, but is enduring with mindfulness and comprehension the
physical pain which is tormenting, acute, harsh, severe, nasty and
unpleasant!&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another deva uttered
this expression of joy in the presence of the Bhagava:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Friends! How like the
unrivalled bull is Samana Gotama! It is because he is like the unrivalled bull
that he is not complaining at all, but is enduring with mindfulness and
comprehension the physical pain which is tormenting, acute, harsh, severe,
nasty and unpleasant.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another deva uttered
this expression of joy in the presence of the Bhagava:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Friends! How like the
draught ox is Samana Gotama! It is because he is like the draught ox that he is
not complaining at all, but is enduring with mindfulnes and comprehension the
physical pain which is tormenting, acute, harsh, severe, nasty and
unpleasant!&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another deva uttered
the expression of joy in the presence of the Bhagava:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Friends! How
self-disciplined is Samana Gotama. It is because he is self-disciplined that he
is not complaining at all, but is enduring with mindfulness and comprehension
the physical pain which is tormenting, acute, harsh, severe, nasty, and
unpleasant!&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another deva uttered
this expression of joy in the presence of the Bhagava:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look at the perfectly
developed concentration (of the Bhagava)! Look at the mind that is completely
released (from defilements), that is not swayed (by greed), that is not turned
away (by anger), and that does not need any effort towards suppression (of
passion). Who ever would consider hurting such man who is like the powerful
elephant, the brave lion, who is a hero, who is like the unrivalled bull, the
draught ox, and who is self-disciplined, must be nothing but a stupid
person!&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Then the Bhagava said:)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The brahmins who are
adept in the five Vedas and follow the austere practice may strive for a
hundred years. yet their mind cannot gain complete release from defilements.
Lowly as their mind is, they can never cross over to the other shore (Nibbana).
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Those who are
overwhelmed by Craving and who follow rites and rituals outside the Ariya Path
may engage themselves in mortifying practices for a hundred years, yet their
mind cannot gain complete release from defilements. Lowly as their mind is,
they can never cross over to the other shore (Nibbana).</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In this world, he who
is conceited<SUP>3 </SUP>, lacks self-control (i.e., tranquillity of mind).</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one who lacks
tranquillity of mind, there can be no Magga Insight. A forest-dweller may lead
a lonely life, yet if he lacks mindfulness, he cannot cross over the planes of
existences where death prevails, to the other shore(which is Nibbana).</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He who abandons
conceit, who has a tranquilled mind, and who has wisdom is free from
(attachment to) all existence. A forest-dweller leading a lonely life, if he
practises mindfulness, can cross over the planes of existence where death
prevails to the other shore (which is Nibbana).&quot; </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">End of the Sakalika Sutta,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">the eighth in this vagga.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Maddakucchi Park: So
called because it was the place where Queen Vedehi, mother of the patricide
Prince Ajatasattu, on learning the potential danger of her own child she was
carrying in her womb, tried unsuccessfully to abort the child foetus.
<I>(Maddati, </I>to press, to trample; <I>kucchi</I>, the belly, the womb)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The splinter of rock that
struck the Buddha's foot was the result of bhikkhu Devadatta's attempt against
the Buddha's life. While the Buddha was at the foot of Mount Gijiakuta,
Devadatta rolled a boulder down on him. But the boulder, struck another boulder
on the way down and only a splinter hit the Buddha's foot.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. He who is conceited:
<I>manakamassa</I>: lit., for him who desires conceit.</P>
