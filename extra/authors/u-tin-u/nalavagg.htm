(Discourse on Crossing the Flood)</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 .Thus have I heard:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the Bhagava was residing
at the Jetavana Monastery of Anathapindika in Savatthi. Then, soon after the
middle watch of the night. a certain deva of exceeding beauty approached the
Bhagava, illuminating the entire Jetavana Monastery. After paying homage to the
Bhagava. he stood at a suitable place. Thus standing, he addressed the Bhagava:
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Sir, how did you cross
the flood? <SUP>1</SUP></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friend, by not remaining
still, and by not putting forth strenuous effort, I crossed the flood.&quot; 
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But Sir, in what way
did you cross the flood, neither remaining still, nor putting forth strenuous
effort.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Friend, if I remain
still. I sink; <SUP>2</SUP></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if I put forth strenuous
effort, I drift <SUP>3</SUP></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, by neither remaining
still nor putting forth strenuous effort, I crossed the flood.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In the sentient world,
only after a long time do I see one in whom asavas are extinct, <SUP>4
</SUP>one in whom</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defilements have been
extinguished and who neither remaining still nor putting forth strenuous
effort, has crossed the ocean of Craving.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus said the deva. The
Teacher approved. Having noted the approval of the Teacher, the deva paid
homage to the Bhagava, respectfully withdrew and vanished form there.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">End of the Oghatarana Sutta, </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">the first in this vagga. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="-1"><B>FOOTNOTES</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. the flood: <B>ogha</B>:
metaphorically, the waters of Craving, Wrong View and Ignorance which keep one
submerged in the round of existences (samsara).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Four oghas are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>(i) <B>Kama ogha</B>: strong attachment to the five sensual pleasures: 
</LI>
<LI>(ii)<B> Bhava ogha</B>: strong attachment to rebirth in the Fine, Material
Sphere or the Non-material Sphere or to the attainment of Jhanas leading to
these spheres; </LI>
<LI>(iii)<B> Ditthi ogha</B>: the 62 wrong views (See Brahmajala Sutta,
Silakkhandha Vagga, Digha Nikaya); </LI>
<LI> (vi) <B>Avijja ogha</B>: Ignorance of the Truth.</LI>
</UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If I remain still, I sink;
Staying amidst sensual pleasures, and making no efforts to break away from
them, one sinks to the tower realms. Or, in another sense, making no effort to
get rid of demeritoriousness, one sinks to the depths of the four miserable
states.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. If I put forth strenuous
effort, I drift: Striving for purification from defilement based on
self-mortification sends one adrift in samsara. Or, in another sense, even if
one does meritorious deeds while craving for the higher realms of existence,
such efforts merely bring mundane merit and one drifts along in samsara.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. One in whom asavas are
extinct: brahmana: Meaning either a Buddha or an arahat. The brahma, designated
as a certain deva in this discourse, had known Kassapa Buddha. Since the
passing away of Kassapa Buddha many aeons passed before Gotama Buddha appeared
in this world. </P>

exceeding beauty approached the Bhagava, illuminating the entire Jetavana

Thus standing, he addressed the Bhagava:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sir, do you know what
the freedom from defilements <SUP>1</SUP> is, what the Fruition of freedom from
defilements<SUP>2 </SUP>is. and what the complete absence of dukkha<SUP>3</SUP>
is for sentient beings?&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Friend, I know what the
freedom from defilements is, what the Fruition of freedom from defilements is,
and what the complete absence of dukkha is for sentient beings.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But , Sir, in what
manner do you understand the freedom from defilements, the Fruition of freedom
from defilements, and the complete absence of dukkha for sentient beings?&quot;
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Friend, the exhaustion
of the kammic causal process based on craving for existence,<SUP>4 </SUP>the
extinction of Perception and Consciousness,<SUP>5 </SUP>and the cessation and
stilling of Sensation<SUP>6 </SUP> these I understand as the freedom from
defilements, the Fruition of freedom from defilements and the complete absence

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. the freedom from
defilements. This refers to Arahatta Magga. For if one attains Arahatta Magga,
one is instantly released from the bondage of defilements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. the Fruition of freedom
from defilements: This means the Fruition of Magga-Insight which is the
knowledge that immediately follows the attainment of Arahatta Magga.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. the complete absence of
dukkha: This means Nibbana. Only when Nibbana is realized, the cycle of
suffering connected with rebirth is ended.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. the exhaustion of the
kammic causal process based on craving for existence; (nandibhava parikkhaya): 
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kammic causal process (kamma
bhava) means volitional activities that cause rebirth in the three bhumis or
Spheres of existence, i.e., existence in the Sensual Sphere, Fine Material
Sphere and Non-material Sphere. This refers to the Aggregate of Volitional
Activities sankharakkhandha).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. the extinction of
Perception and Consciousness; (sannavinnana sankhaya):</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This refers to the Aggregate
of Perception (sannakkhandha) and the Aggregate of Consciousness
(vinnanakkhandha) which rise together with the Aggregate of volitional
activities (asankharakkhandha).When these three mental aggregates be come
extinct, the Aggregate of Sensation (vedanakkhandha) which is inseparable from
them, also becomes extinct.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the above two expressions,
namely, nandibhava parikkhaya and sannavinnana sankhaya, the Buddha expounds
the total extinction of the four causative mental aggregates from the moment
arahatship is attained. This is called the realization of Nibbana in this very
existence (sa-upadisesanibbana). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. the cessation and stilling
of Sensation: (vedananam nirodha upasama).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein, 'Sensation' means the
Aggregate of Sensation (vedanakkhandha) which is the resultant aggregate that
arises due to volitional activities in the previous existences. The cessation
and stilling of the Aggregate of Sensation necessarily implies cessation and
stilling of the three other mental aggregates. And the cessation and stilling
of the four mental aggregates necessarily implies the cessation and stilling of
their basis, their object, the aggregate of Corporeality (rupakkhanda). By this
expression the Buddha expounds the total extinction of the resultant five
aggregates of existence, which is the realization of Nibbana with the complete
cessation of the five aggregates (anupadisesa-nibbana).</P>

future<SUP>2</SUP>but are contented with whatever is at hand, keep their

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. They who do not brood over
the past: Circumstances may have changed for the worse. For instance, in the
past there may have been devoted rulers who tended well to the needs of the
Samgha so that the members of the Samgha had lived in comfort. Now that times
have changed and food and robes have become scarce, the wise bhikkhu does not
brood over the past easier days but takes life with equanimity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. And do not wish for a
favourable future: Such a wise bhikkhu does not speculate on rosier days ahead.
Perhaps another devout ruler might reign again when milk and honey would flow
for the Samgha. But such worldly thoughts do not occur to the true bhikkhu.</P>
