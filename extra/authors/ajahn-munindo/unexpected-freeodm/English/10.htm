		&nbsp;It is wisdom that enables letting go of a lesser happiness<br>
		in pursuit of a happiness which is greater. </i><br>
		<br>
		Dhammapada verse 290<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		During my years at High School I received regular encouragement to enter 
		the annual speech contest, organised by the local Rotary Club. I think 
		my parents’ encouragement was partly to do with preparing me for my 
		hopefully taking up the family tradition of becoming a Protestant 
		preacher. Whatever the motivation, I benefited from the challenge. There 
		were two years in which I recall doing quite well. In one I spoke about 
		a hero of mine at that time, Dr. Albert Schweitzer, and in the other I 
		spoke on the subject of whether religion should be comforting or 
		challenging. I remain interested in both of these subjects but on this 
		occasion I would like to take up the latter as the subject of my talk: 
		should religion be comforting or challenging? This concern warrants 
		consideration whatever stage in practice we may be at. What is it that 
		we are looking for in our experience of religion? Are we looking for 
		comfort? Are we looking for a consoling message? Or does our religion 
		challenge us? And what do we think that it ought to be doing? My own 
		commitment has been born of an enthusiastic interest in both of these 
		things – in finding real comfort and skilful challenges. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Finding comfort in the Dhamma</i><br>
		<br>
		How is the experience of religion comforting, or how should it be so? In 
		the Buddhist scriptures as well as in everyday experience we find that 
		the impulse to engage with the inner life, the spiritual life, is often 
		prompted by suffering. This was as true in the time of the Buddha as it 
		is these days – dissatisfaction or unhappiness causes beings to look for 
		something more than the happiness that comes with sensual gratification. 
		We are told that it wasn’t pleasure that inspired the Buddha to take up 
		the life of renunciation in pursuit of liberation. It was the despair 
		that arose out of seeing old age, sickness and death. Seeing these took 
		the Buddha-to-be into a state of despondency as he thought, ‘Are these 
		things going to happen to me too?’ And then inspiration and hope arose 
		when the Buddha-to-be, the bodhisatta, saw a renunciate, a seeker, 
		somebody engaged in a life concerned with seeking an alternative to pain 
		and despair. <br>
		<br>
		It must be understood, however, that the reason the bodhisatta was able 
		to embark on the arduous and life-threatening task of uncovering the 
		path to liberation was because he was ready to do so. In the records of 
		the Buddha’s own comments on his path of practice we are told that he 
		spent many life-times cultivating patience, loving-kindness, 
		renunciation and many other virtues so he would have the strength to 
		take up this task. One of the things I take from such stories is the 
		encouragement to cultivate the necessary strengths needed on the 
		journey. Learning to be comfortable with ourselves is one aspect of 
		cultivating strength.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Finding Comfort with Friends</i><br>
		<br>
		Today a group of people came to the monastery to inter someone’s ashes. 
		There was great sadness because it was a young man who had died. It was 
		a tragic death, and there was real grief felt by family and friends. We 
		all know that Buddhism teaches that we suffer because we are attached. 
		But it would be altogether inappropriate to confront people who are 
		suffering at such a time with this teaching. If you have lost somebody 
		dear to you, and you go to your Buddhist friends for some solace and 
		comfort, and they tell you, ‘Well, you shouldn’t have got attached to 
		them in the first place! Everything is impermanent, unsatisfactory and 
		not self!’, it would be grossly insensitive. <br>
		<br>
		We look for comfort when we are suffering, and I feel that it is right 
		to look for it in the various skilful means and practices that are 
		offered as part of Buddhism. Besides the pain that comes from loss there 
		is a lot in the world around us that causes us to suffer. The current 
		global environmental situation, the various military conflicts, the 
		ongoing struggles we see in peoples’ lives – acute crises or just 
		everyday mediocrity – all this can leave us feeling terribly saddened. 
		If, with the heart burdened by sadness, we attempt to turn towards the 
		deeper causes of suffering before we are ready, we could sink further 
		into despair. Sometimes what we need is to find friends and companions 
		who are not going to condemn us for suffering. Our suffering is not a 
		sign that we’re failing; it’s not an indictment. However, it is only too 
		easy to fall for the worldly perspective that says if we are suffering 
		we are failing. If we are upset then we’re supposed to get over it. But 
		there are some things we just don’t get over. Some pain doesn’t heal in 
		the way we wish or at the time we want. At such times, to have a friend, 
		somebody who shows a willing receptivity to our suffering, is a very 
		great comfort. Spiritual companions, kalyanamittas, are one of the most 
		important comforts in life.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Sanctuary</i><br>
		<br>
		It’s also important to have places that we can go, places like this 
		monastery, which are sanctuaries. I feel strongly that to have a place 
		like this to go to, a place consecrated to truth and reality, is a great 
		solace. You don’t have to be famous or popular or good-looking or 
		wealthy to go to a monastery; the doors are open, and there’s no charge 
		for staying. You can bring your suffering, offer it up and feel it 
		received. This is a great comfort and a skilful way of dealing with 
		suffering. And as one teacher I lived with told us, “Don’t wait until 
		you have a problem before establishing a relationship.” He was talking 
		at the time about relating to a teacher but the principle holds true for 
		a place of sanctuary as well. Just as when we move into a new town we 
		would sensibly find ourselves a good doctor and not wait until we were 
		sick, it is likewise sensible to become acquainted with places and 
		groups that might be available to us before we find ourselves feeling 
		challenged.<br>
		<br>
		<i>The place of ritual</i><br>
		<br>
		The ritual practices that we’re encouraged to cultivate are also skilful 
		ways of finding comfort in practice. Dedicating puñña or merit is 
		something that one can do, particularly at funerals and such sad 
		occasions, when we might feel helpless in the face of our suffering. The 
		people who came today – there was nothing they could do to bring back 
		their son, their brother, their friend, who had passed away. But to be 
		able to do something wholesome, to generate some goodness, is 
		comforting. A traditional Buddhist way of generating goodness is to come 
		to the monastery, a place dedicated to reality, and to make a gesture of 
		support to the place and to the monks and nuns who live there. And then 
		one can dedicate the goodness or merit of this act to the person who has 
		died. <br>
		<br>
		This idea may not feel immediately appealing or comforting because it’s 
		not something that we are familiar with, but when one does such things 
		as skilful means there can nevertheless be a surprising sense of comfort 
		when the heart exercises its ability to generate goodness. We can do 
		good deeds by way of body, speech and mind; through acts of kindness, 
		through restraint, through generosity, through cultivating honesty and 
		impeccability – these wholesome actions generate a storehouse of 
		goodness that we can then dedicate. The last act I perform each day 
		before going to bed is to dedicate to all beings whatever goodness I 
		might have created by way of body, speech or mind. I spend some time 
		going through ‘all beings’ – from my teachers, parents, companions, 
		friends, rulers, enemies … Sometimes it can take a while and when I am 
		tired and want to get to bed I might cut it a bit shorter but I rarely, 
		if ever, miss out the practice. It is very important to me.<br>
		<br>
		There are also the meditations on loving-kindness and compassion. These 
		clear, concrete practices generate a tangible sense of comfort that 
		strengthens us inwardly. We do need to know that we have things we can 
		do to generate such inner well-being. It is not the case that we are 
		always ready to turn around and ask of ourselves the deepest questions 
		regarding the causes of suffering. <br>
		<br>
		Chanting is another profoundly comforting thing to do. In times of great 
		despair or grief we can still chant. When I knew my father was in 
		hospital, having had a series of strokes, I felt painfully helpless in 
		being unable to offer any meaningful support at a time when I really 
		wanted to. It was made worse in finding that there was nothing I could 
		do to settle my mind in meditation. However, chanting did help. On that 
		occasion I felt very grateful that I had been encouraged to learn to 
		recite some of the suttas. Even though I wasn’t seeing reality, I could 
		recite these verses about reality, about truth. The act of recitation 
		was a source of real comfort. <br>
		<br>
		The Buddha taught that we need to exercise discernment in choosing the 
		appropriate time and place before going deeper into the true causes of 
		suffering. If someone is hungry, for instance, you should feed them 
		before teaching them Dhamma. He instructed the monks that they shouldn’t 
		teach people with empty bellies that the cause of their suffering was 
		their ignorance of the Four Noble Truths! The decent thing to do, of 
		course, was to feed them first. If we maintain a clear awareness of what 
		is going on in each and every situation, with the right motivation in 
		our heart we will intuitively know what the appropriate way to behave 
		is. Appropriate action follows from seeing the correct context of things 
		and then acting accordingly. Although the Buddha’s teaching encourages 
		us to challenge ourselves to enquire into how we are creating our own 
		suffering, this sometimes arduous work can only be undertaken in the 
		context of inner well-being.<br>
		<br>
		<i>First comfort, then challenge</i><br>
		<br>
		So certainly it is the place of religion to offer comfort and solace to 
		people when needed. But herein lies a paradox: We need to know how to 
		make ourselves feel good and strong in wholesome ways, but attachment to 
		those very good feelings is what keeps us stuck. We make our lives 
		comfortable by according with our natural preferences. We prefer not to 
		be sad, not to be uncomfortable, hungry, miserable, depressed or lonely. 
		Having good friends, physical health and emotional comfort are natural 
		ways of being happy, but the practice of purification means going 
		against our preferences, countering the belief that we need these 
		comforts to be happy. If we don’t understand how these different 
		dimensions of spiritual practice function – if we don’t understand the 
		place of comfort through having our preferences met, and the place of 
		challenge that comes through going against our preferences – then we can 
		get confused. If we try to engage with the teachings of the Buddha or 
		any great spiritual master who challenges our usual preferences, yet 
		while doing this we feel inwardly depleted and diminished, without 
		confidence and well-being, we can make ourselves feel a whole lot worse.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Going against preferences</i><br>
		<br>
		The practice of purification requires our coming to see the reality of 
		preferences very clearly. And this inevitably involves the challenge of 
		countering our desires. There needs to be a context of contentment for 
		us to do this, but at the same time going against preferences is not 
		going to be comfortable. It’s important to understand this, because when 
		we apply ourselves to practices that challenge us, and we feel unhappy 
		or discontented, we can think that something is going wrong. <br>
		<br>
		I have many times quoted to people something I read in a book by Thomas 
		Merton during my first years as a monk. As sometimes happens, hearing a 
		description of the process one is involved in from the perspective of 
		another tradition can bring about greater clarity. In his book, New 
		Seeds for Contemplation, Thomas Merton writes – <br>
		<br>
		What a holocaust takes place in the steady burning to ashes of old 
		worn-out words, clichés, slogans, rationalisations. The worst of it is 
		that even the apparently holy conceptions are consumed along with all 
		the rest. It is a terrible breaking and burning of idols, a purification 
		of the sanctuary so that no graven thing may occupy the place that God 
		has commanded to be left empty: the centre, the existential altar which 
		simply “is”. <br>
		<br>
		For contemplative life to deepen we do need to be willing to have our 
		comfort challenged. <br>
		<br>
		… Let no one hope to find in contemplation an escape from conflict, from 
		anguish or from doubt. On the contrary, the deep, inexpressible 
		certitude of the contemplative experience awakens a tragic anguish and 
		opens many questions in the depths of the heart like wounds that cannot 
		stop bleeding. For every gain in deep certitude there is a corresponding 
		growth of superficial doubt. This doubt is by no means opposed to 
		genuine faith, but it mercilessly examines and questions the spurious 
		‘faith’ of everyday life, the human faith which is nothing but passive 
		acceptance of conventional opinion. (Thomas Merton, New Seeds for 
		Contemplation, New York, New Directions Pub., 1974) <br>
		<br>
		<i>Making preference conscious</i><br>
		<br>
		The wise way to relate to our preferences is to recognise that everyone 
		has them but that, when they are not understood, they limit our 
		experience. We all prefer to have agreeable sensations – it’s completely 
		natural to have bodily preferences. In meditation for example, we are 
		encouraged to be still, to discipline the body, to focus attention until 
		body and mind are in harmony and we attain to one-pointedness. In the 
		tranquillity of such samadhi one is able to read the mind’s reality 
		quite differently from when body and mind are distracted and dissipated. 
		We are encouraged to cultivate this one-pointedness, and when we 
		experience it there is no doubt about its value. Yet to reach such 
		stillness, there has to be restraint. When we sit still, the body often 
		feels uncomfortable, and this discomfort doesn’t accord with our 
		preferences. If we don’t understand that our preferences need to be 
		countered, then we won’t be able to get to this one-pointedness with 
		which we can more accurately read reality. We will feel uncomfortable, 
		get distracted and move.<br>
		<br>
		We don’t go against our preferences because there’s anything inherently 
		wrong with preferences. In truth that which is causing the problem is 
		the way we relate to our preferences. We counter them so we are not 
		pushed around by them. Our enjoyment of pleasure is natural and yet we 
		get ourselves into all sorts of tangles in our pursuit of it. If we are 
		suffering as a result of our pursuit of pleasure, an initial attitude 
		might be to take a position against pleasure; we interpret the Buddha’s 
		teachings as saying that our preference for pleasure over pain is in 
		itself the cause of suffering. If this is our motivation for practice, 
		again we could cause ourselves more troubles. We should remember the 
		exhortation to exercise extreme care in how we pick up the teachings. In 
		the chant we recite together in the monastery every two weeks after the 
		recitation of the Patimokkha rules there is a verse that says: ‘This 
		training wrongly held will lead to increased pain, just as kusa grass 
		wrongly-grasped will cut the hand’. Kusa grass is a tough grass they 
		have in India that has a sharp edge. I’m sure you get the picture. More 
		immediately we could talk about going out to cut the grass along the 
		edge of the walking meditation tracks in the walled garden and, instead 
		of picking up the sickle by the handle, heedlessly picking it up by the 
		blade; we’d cut our hand. Not only will we have increased our suffering, 
		but also now we won’t be able to cut the grass.<br>
		<br>
		The Buddha’s metaphor for picking up the training on restraint rightly 
		applies especially to the training in celibacy. Making the choice to 
		renounce intentional sexual activity is not a recipe for an easy life. 
		Buddhist scriptures and our own European monastic records are filled 
		with stories of tragic misadventure on this path. So our training is 
		always emphasising mindfulness in our efforts to be restrained. Feelings 
		of sexual interest are not to be blindly controlled with will, nor are 
		they to be dismissed with habitual judgement as ‘wrong’ or ‘right’ as 
		the case may be. Rather they are to be fully received with awareness and 
		sensitivity, as they manifest. They are simply to be known but not 
		followed. In this way restraint of the untamed passions is exercised, 
		energy is contained and made available for the process of purifying the 
		heart of greed, aversion and delusion. We are going against our 
		conditioned superficial preferences, but in a way that leads to freedom, 
		not more stress.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Another type of comfort</i><br>
		<br>
		So the tools of spiritual discipline must be picked up in the right way. 
		The challenges to our preferences need to be grasped with right 
		understanding. If we always cultivate feeling comfortable, if we always 
		give ourselves what we want when we want it, then the chances are that 
		we will never get to see preferences as preferences. We will never get 
		to see our likes and dislikes as merely conditioned tendencies of mind. 
		If we always follow our preferences then we will always feel like they 
		are ‘me’. Every time I give myself what I want, ‘I’ feel gratified, and 
		this ‘I’ grows a little bigger and a little happier. And every time I 
		succeed in avoiding that which I don’t like, ‘I’ feel a little more 
		pleased with myself. But the way of the Dhamma is not always to give 
		ourselves what we want, and not always to turn away from that which we 
		don’t like. In this way we go against our preferences in order to see 
		their conditioned nature. By practising according to these principles we 
		discover the possibility of another level of comfort.<br>

		There is an initial level of comfort or happiness that comes from 
		gratifying our desires and according with our preferences, and there is 
		another level of happiness which comes as a direct result of our 
		willingness to go against desires – from knowing that we don’t have to 
		gratify our desires – from understanding that all our preferences are 
		conditioned. That’s why I say that purification, the primary spiritual 
		activity, means opposing preferences in order to learn about the greater 
		comfort that is the heart being at ease with itself. Such comfort is not 
		merely physical, mental or emotional, but is a contentment in the core 
		of our being that arises with understanding, with seeing clearly. <br>
		<br>
		Some years ago I accepted an invitation to visit a friend in Beijing 
		with the aim of going together with him to Kyoto in Japan. I had wanted 
		to go to Japan for as long as I could remember and since my friend was 
		working in China and I was en route from visiting family in New Zealand 
		back to the UK, it wasn’t too big a deviation to stop off in China. The 
		thought of going there occupied my mind for a long time in advance. The 
		idea of getting to Japan at last, and seeing those beautiful gardens and 
		temples in Kyoto, was wonderful. But as it happened my connecting flight 
		from Shanghai to Beijing was cancelled. I found myself alone in the 
		airport without any money and with nowhere to stay. It was quite an 
		ordeal, with teams of angry Chinese travellers competing for empty seats 
		on later flights. Almost nobody spoke English and they were not at all 
		impressed with my commitment to the holy-life! Eventually, after nearly 
		losing my passport and standing outside on the tarmac for a long time in 
		the freezing February night, I boarded a very cramped plane and made it 
		to Beijing. But then our baggage was mislaid, and it was not until two 
		the following morning that I got to bed. Meanwhile my friend had 
		returned from a meeting in Hong Kong in which he had been subject to a 
		flagrant betrayal of trust by a co-worker, and his flight had also been 
		delayed. When we woke in the morning we both had sore throats and were 
		thoroughly miserable. When we broached the matter of going to Kyoto it 
		became obvious that neither of us was feeling up to it. After so much 
		planning and anticipation, the thought of not going should have appeared 
		unthinkable. With so much momentum I expected it to be so. But to my 
		surprise and pleasure it was perfectly thinkable. So we decided not to 
		go to Japan. <br>
		<br>
		In meditation that evening I had such a happy feeling knowing that I 
		didn’t have to get what I wanted. There was a clear recognition that the 
		pleasure that comes with the gratification of desire was inferior to the 
		pleasure associated with the freedom of not having to get what I want. 
		There is a verse in the Dhammapada that reads: ‘It is wisdom that 
		enables letting go of a lesser happiness in pursuit of a greater 
		happiness’. That evening I came a little closer to understanding this 
		aspect of the Buddha’s wisdom. As things worked out, by the following 
		morning we both felt fine again, made a dash for the airport and had a 
		marvellous time in Kyoto.<br>
		<br>
		<i>The point of balance</i><br>
		<br>
		If we pick up in the wrong way the Buddha’s teachings about going 
		against our preferences, by thinking that there is some inherent virtue 
		in following our dislikes, then we can hurt ourselves. The Buddha 
		himself, before he was enlightened, followed the path of 
		self-mortification for some years. It made him very unhappy and he 
		nearly died in the process. In the end he realised, ‘Well, that’s not 
		the end of suffering.’ He had already concluded that gratifying his 
		desires and making his life as comfortable as possible didn’t lead to 
		true understanding, because when he had encountered old age, sickness 
		and death, he had become depressed and miserable. But practising 
		asceticism and deliberately frustrating his desires hadn’t solved the 
		problem either. In the end he committed himself to settling the matter 
		once and for all and, seated resolutely under the Bodhi tree, made his 
		final determined effort to awaken. Relying on the accumulation of 
		goodness over many lifetimes, he was able to come to the point of seeing 
		for himself that taking any fixed position for or against his likes and 
		dislikes creates suffering. Learning how not to take a position for or 
		against anything is freedom. The Buddha called his discovery the Middle 
		Way.<br>
		<br>
		This Middle Way, the Buddha said, is born of right understanding 
		regarding the nature of things. But to understand this nature we need to 
		go against our preferences. In the training of sila, we make the effort 
		to refrain from following heedless tendencies. In formal meditation we 
		train ourselves in not moving whenever there is an impulse to do so, and 
		we restrain our minds, containing our attention when the mind’s tendency 
		is to follow some preference. We want to know, ‘Can I choose not to 
		compulsively follow this desire, this preference?’<br>
		<br>
		In the Mahasatipatthana Sutta the Buddha describes the meditator who, 
		experiencing pleasure, just sits with awareness, simply knowing that 
		there is pleasure without adding anything to it or taking anything away 
		from it. But how do we reach the point of knowing there is pleasure 
		without indulging in it, pursuing it and working out how we can get more 
		of it? We get to that point through restraining ourselves. When 
		pleasurable sensations arise, our habits are such that we usually just 
		want to have more of them. There’s an impulse to seek pleasure, based on 
		a preference for pleasurable experience. But if we habitually and 
		blindly follow such a preference there is an unfortunate consequence: 
		when there is suffering, we are not able to restrain ourselves from 
		contending with the pain. If we indulge in an habitual preference for 
		more pleasure, we will habitually make a problem out of pain. But right 
		understanding arises when we become interested in the reality of our 
		preferences. When pleasure arises, are we able to inhibit the tendency 
		to seek more pleasure? – not because we have any opinion about desire, 
		but because we are interested in the reality of desire? Rather than 
		being driven into gratifying our desires we then start to feel drawn 
		towards a freedom from blind habit. <br>
		<br>
		If we don’t understand that Buddhist practice requires us to challenge 
		our preferences then we will feel that pleasure is either something to 
		follow or something to resist or judge. We won’t suspect that there is a 
		middle way between these two options. The teaching of the Middle Way is 
		an encouragement for us to challenge our preferences, to undermine the 
		agreeable and disagreeable appearances of things.<br>
		<br>
		Sometimes we experience real pain and suffering. I don’t mean just a 
		little pain in the knees; I mean the sense that the bottom has fallen 
		out of our world. The apparent reality is that this pain is going to 
		last forever. We think, ‘I can’t stand this, I can’t handle it.’ And of 
		course, we would prefer it not to be this way. But the Dhamma invites us 
		to inhibit the compulsive tendency to be driven into trying to change 
		the situation. Instead, we willingly receive the way this pain expresses 
		itself, just as it is. This is the path of insight practice into the 
		reality of the way things are.<br>
		<br>
		If we remain convinced by the apparent nature of things, if we don’t 
		have faith in this path of practice, then this pain, disappointment, 
		despair, sadness, grief appears permanent and real, and we will believe 
		that we have to do something to solve it or get out of it; anything 
		would be better than being with it. But lacking the commitment to stay 
		with pain, in awareness, we can’t see through the way it appears. <br>
		<br>
		<i>The body’s natural preferences</i><br>
		<br>
		The Dhamma encourages us to generate the understanding we need in order 
		to go against our preferences out of an interest in seeing through into 
		their conditioned nature. There are bodily preferences and mental 
		preferences, and sometimes there isn’t much we can do about changing the 
		body’s preferences; they’re programmed in the body. I prefer peanut 
		butter and Manuka honey on toast for breakfast rather than fermented 
		fish, as people seem to prefer in Thailand. As long as I live, I am sure 
		that I won’t find fish and chillies more agreeable than peanut butter 
		and honey on crunchy toasted brown bread, at any time for that matter. 
		But this level of preference does not have to be a problem, so long as 
		we know it is simply a bodily preference. It is merely due to our 
		upbringing. What we can change though, is how we see our preferences.
		<br>
		<br>
		If I had an uninformed ignorant relationship to my preferences, and an 
		anagarika came into my kuti in the morning to bring me nice toast for 
		breakfast, then I might get lost in my pleasure. I might pay the 
		anagarika compliments, telling him what a fine anagarika he was and how 
		well he was doing. And I would encourage him to bring such toast again 
		the next morning. Then, if the next day he brought me fermented fish for 
		breakfast, I might well fly off the handle and say something hurtful. My 
		uninspected preferences being frustrated would lead to my being upset. 
		If ‘I’ habitually get what ‘I’ want, ‘I’ can get caught up in my 
		preferences. That’s an ignorant relationship to preferences. <br>
		<br>
		In the breakfast situation, were I to remain true to my commitment to 
		going beyond attachment to my preferences, practice would stimulate the 
		willingness to simply feel what it feels like to be disappointed when I 
		don’t get what I want. Then we see that such willingness to receive pain 
		leads to increased presence and clarity in the context of pleasure. We 
		find we are not getting so lost in pleasure and pain. Encountering our 
		preferences is a way to strengthen cultivation of mindfulness, not 
		merely a strategy of driving out unsuitable desires. <br>
		<br>
		If there is a wise and informed relationship to preferences we will be 
		willing to inhibit our tendency to believe in the way things appear for 
		long enough to be able to see through them. We will see that desire is a 
		movement in the mind. It arises, it appears, it can be felt, it can be 
		received into awareness without judgement, and it will disappear, like a 
		piece of dust floating through space. The space doesn’t interfere with 
		the dust nor is it disturbed by the dust floating through it. A wave 
		rippling across the ocean doesn’t change the nature of the ocean; it’s 
		natural for an ocean to have waves moving across it. But the wave 
		doesn’t define the nature of the ocean. Likewise a desire passing 
		through the mind does not define the mind. If we have seen this, if we 
		have inhibited our tendency to follow our preferences for long enough to 
		see through the way desire arises and passes away, then we have a much 
		freer perspective on preferences.<br>
		<br>
		Whether toast and honey or fermented fish turns up for breakfast, 
		whether this is agreeable or disagreeable to one’s bodily preferences, 
		the heart will not become elated or depressed. That’s the important 
		principle: that we are able to see through our preferences so that the 
		heart remains free. If we understand and accept this principle then we 
		can be willing to endure whatever is disagreeable to us. We won’t always 
		look for life to be agreeable. We won’t say, ‘I had a really good 
		meditation,’ just because it felt pleasant. I often hear people asking, 
		‘how was your meditation?’ Their friend then replies something like, 
		‘hopeless, really terrible.’ If I ask them, ‘what was hopeless about 
		it?’ they say, ‘Well, the mind wouldn’t settle. There were no peaceful 
		feelings, no clarity.’ And I ask, ‘Did you know that it wasn’t peaceful? 
		Did you know that there wasn’t any clarity?’ Then they say, ‘Yes, I 
		knew.’ So what makes such a meditation terrible? Only that it didn’t 
		agree with their preferences. If someone says to me, ‘The meditation was 
		very good, the body alert and energetic, the mind bright and clear. My 
		practice is going really well,’ what they usually mean is that it agreed 
		with their preference.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Training</i><br>
		<br>
		Training involves a conscious willingness to go against our preferences. 
		It does not mean merely upholding a philosophical opinion that 
		gratifying our desires is wrong. This would be only a conceptual 
		approach to training. Training means discovering a willingness to go 
		against our preferences for the sake of understanding, so that we can 
		find freedom from them. We might not manage to change our preferences, 
		but we find a freedom from being driven by them.<br>
		<br>
		I would prefer that the world be harmonious and that everybody got on 
		with everyone else. The reality is that there is a lot of conflict. My 
		preference is frustrated, but does that mean that I have to fall into 
		despair? If I do fall into despair, from the Buddha’s perspective, 
		that’s the result of an ignorant way of relating to preferences. A wise 
		way of relating would mean that we still feel sadness and 
		disappointment, but they do not obstruct inner clarity and calm. Our 
		discernment is not compromised; our capacity for contemplating the 
		predicament we’re in is not compromised by the way we feel.<br>
		<br>
		When we have truly settled into practice and internalised this principle 
		of training ourselves to go against our preferences, we don’t approach 
		life looking for it to be agreeable or perceive it as a failure because 
		it is disagreeable. We don’t approach our meditation expecting it to be 
		pleasant. If we go on retreat and we don’t have the profound insights we 
		hoped for, we won’t feel the retreat to be a failure. When our 
		relationships feel strained and we’re not getting on with each other, we 
		won’t say it’s all going wrong. We feel pain, and this is disagreeable, 
		but to think that there is anything wrong with this is to add something 
		unnecessary to the experience. It might be painful, but if we have a 
		willingness to approach that pain with interest, to challenge our 
		preferences, then from the Buddha’s perspective we’re on the path that 
		leads to understanding.<br>
		<br>
		There is a happiness that comes from seeing through something that used 
		to appear threatening. When you experience a clarity that is born of 
		understanding that desire is not the way it appears to be, that pain is 
		not the way it appears to be, then you can allow all sorts of previously 
		uncomfortable phenomena into your mind. In the beginning of practice, 
		when you were a little sensitive to what goes on in the mind, you might 
		have noticed that it was full of all sorts of unwholesome desires. 
		Perhaps you started to feel ashamed about some of the tendencies of your 
		mind, but that’s because you were still caught up in them. If we 
		practise rightly, restraining the tendency to follow these things, and 
		if we study them and observe them, then maybe one day we will see 
		through them. Desire or ill will or fear can arise in the mind yet we 
		will remain clear, confident and open as we sit with awareness. We abide 
		as the awareness in which these states are taking place. They pass 
		through awareness; they arise, they are there, and then they cease, but 
		we’re not disturbed by them. When we begin to experience this, the heart 
		is learning to abide in another level of comfort altogether.<br>
