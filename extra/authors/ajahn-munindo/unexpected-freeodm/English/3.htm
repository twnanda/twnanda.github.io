		Beings free from addiction to sensual pleasures<br>
		know a unique form of delight.</i><br>
		<br>
		Dhammapada, verse 99<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		As followers of the Theravada Buddhist tradition we might feel like we 
		have heard so much and read so much on the subject of mindfulness that 
		any more on it could put us to sleep. If we have such reaction, however, 
		it is because we assume that we already know as much about mindfulness 
		as we need for the work in which we are involved. On this occasion I 
		would like us to try to put all assumptions aside and consider anew our 
		understanding of this spiritual faculty. <br>
		<br>
		I should say from the outset that in talking about this area of 
		practice, I don’t feel confident that any one English word really does 
		the job of translating the Pali word sati. This important word has many 
		subtleties of meaning. Accordingly I sometimes use the words 
		‘mindfulness’, ‘awareness’ or ‘attention’ synonymously. Sometimes I use 
		the word ‘knowingness’. Although this last word is clumsy, I find that 
		it adds a helpful dimension of meaning that can be missing from more 
		orthodox translations. It might also be helpful to know that the word 
		sati originally meant ‘memory’ or ‘recollection’. <br>
		<br>
		However we choose to translate this word sati, it refers to a faculty 
		that the Buddha often spoke about as having profound spiritual 
		significance. Other spiritual faculties – faith, energy, concentration 
		and understanding – are taught in various great religions of the world; 
		but the Buddha was unique in making it clear that the practice of 
		mindfulness was essential to our liberation. In the scriptures there are 
		many images given as an aid for us to grasp the essence of this aspect 
		of the teaching. We are encouraged, for example, to cultivate a quality 
		of attention in the present moment as though we were walking around with 
		a barrel of boiling tar on our heads. It is necessary to be awake and 
		alert, with the faculty of awareness fully activated, so that we are not 
		waylaid or confused by any thoughts and feelings that we may experience 
		while going about our daily business. <br>
		<br>
		Being mindful, we are aware of the world just the way it is. This 
		sensitive organism encounters its world through the various impressions 
		it receives through the eyes, ears, tongue, nose, body and mind, and all 
		of this we remain aware of. We are also taught to maintain an awareness 
		of the nature of this sensory existence, being subject as it is to 
		constant change. The Buddha wanted us to understand that if there is the 
		right kind of mindfulness, or right quality of attention, then we don’t 
		mistake these impressions for being more than they are. It is because we 
		mistake these impressions for being more than they are that we suffer. 
		If we don’t want to suffer, if we don’t want to be confused and unhappy, 
		then what we need to do is correct the way we understand our lives.<br>
		<br>
		With various metaphors and words of encouragement the Buddha taught how 
		to cultivate a particular quality of attention that can be applied in 
		every moment. He advised us to apply this attention while sitting or 
		standing, walking or lying down, in short, in whatever posture we find 
		ourselves. We might think that spiritual practice is something that we 
		do in a special place, like a Dhamma hall or retreat centre, or that 
		it’s a special activity, like sitting on a meditation cushion. Of 
		course, these things play an important role in the formal aspect of 
		practice, but properly speaking our ongoing spiritual practice is being 
		fully present in every moment, whatever is happening. It means not 
		dividing up our experience into that which is worthy of mindfulness and 
		that which is not. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Identifying with pleasure and pain</i><br>
		<br>
		In his own lifetime, the Buddha experienced the limitation of being 
		identified with and caught up in his sense-impressions. The traditional 
		story is that he spent the first part of his life cultivating pleasure 
		in every way possible. Then around the age of twenty-nine he encountered 
		old age, sickness and death, and these really unsettled him and he fell 
		into despair. Having been caught up during his early years in defining 
		himself in terms of pleasurable experience, he went to the other extreme 
		and became an ascetic. He found a new identity by defining himself in 
		terms of painful feelings, to see how much pain he could put up with; he 
		embraced the popular religious view of the time that self-mortification 
		would purify and liberate you.<br>
		<br>
		These sorts of attitudes are not unusual, even today. People try to get 
		as much pleasure as possible from sensory experience in order to define 
		themselves. How pleasant can ‘I’ make ‘my’ house? How much pleasure can 
		‘I’ get out of ‘my’ relationship or the environment in which ‘I’ live 
		in? I’ll have nice fragrant smells in the bathroom and agreeable 
		sensations, textures and experiences in my life. This attitude is based 
		on a perfectly natural and understandable preference for pleasure, and 
		to varying extents we’ve all experienced it. But it can be taken to an 
		extreme whereby if we are not feeling pleasure then we feel like we’re 
		failing. <br>
		<br>
		We all know on some level that pleasure comes and goes. If we maintain 
		an awareness of this, then whenever we have a pleasant experience we 
		simply know that the experience is agreeable. We do not become lost in 
		or cling to the pleasure of that experience. For instance, in the last 
		few weeks the weather here has been very agreeable indeed. As summer 
		draws to a close and autumn arrives, living here in Northumberland can 
		feel quite wonderful. The fragrances of the countryside, the mellow 
		colours of the late summer evenings, the harvest, the blue sky, the 
		birds and the fruit are glorious. And with such nice people around and 
		friendly visitors to the monastery, one can experience a comfortable, 
		pleasant feeling of well-being. If there is presence of mind in the 
		moment, however, then when there is this good feeling, there’s also a 
		‘knowingness’, an awareness of the pleasure in experience. And this 
		knowingness doesn’t detract from the pleasure. <br>
		<br>
		Just as we can define ourselves in terms of pleasure, we can also do so 
		through pain, with disagreeable physical or emotional sensations. For 
		the Buddha-to-be, identifying himself with pleasurable sensations hadn’t 
		liberated him, so he thought that identifying himself with pain might do 
		the job. He became an ascetic. His self-mortification consisted in 
		fasting, not drinking and even in not breathing for sustained periods of 
		time, as well as other forms of asceticism that increased the sense of 
		physical frustration. <br>
		<br>
		Most of us don’t attempt the extremes of asceticism to which the 
		Buddha-to-be subjected himself, but we do much the same when we allow 
		ourselves to become lost in depression or anger. I meet many people who 
		for years have been dwelling in anger – their resentment is painful to 
		see. These people may say they want to let go of their anger, but it is 
		sometimes quite clear that they have a commitment to dwelling on it. 
		They find a sense of security in defining themselves as unhappy or angry 
		– at least some sense of safety-with-the-familiar can be found in it. We 
		can even get addicted to feeling afraid, if it gives us the sense of 
		being somebody. Without any other perceivable way of establishing 
		ourselves in a feeling of safety we are unable to let go. <br>
		<br>
		In the absence of informed awareness, when we encounter pleasure we tend 
		to define ourselves in terms of the pleasant feelings that arise. We 
		become addicted simply to being our feelings. Even having a bad feeling 
		makes us feel like we’re somebody. Not feeling anything can appear very 
		threatening. <br>
		<br>
		The Buddha-to-be’s own investigation into his relationship with his 
		feelings eventually showed him that indulging in painful feeling took 
		him to the same place as his years of indulging in pleasurable feelings 
		– unhappiness. He realised this wasn’t a way to liberation either. 
		Instead, he discovered a Middle Way between a life identified with 
		pleasure and one identified with pain, which involved this quality of 
		awareness he called Right Mindfulness – regarding all of experience with 
		a presence of mind that meant that he wasn’t deterred from investigating 
		experiences, mental, physical, emotional, subtle, coarse or anything 
		else. <br>
		<br>
		On this Middle Way, we are encouraged to cultivate mindfulness so that 
		we don’t misperceive things. When pleasure comes along there is 
		‘knowingness’ – ‘this is pleasure.’ We don’t get lost in that pleasure. 
		When there’s pain and misery, or disappointment and a sense of failure, 
		or we are visited by fear or anxiety, we feel it but we don’t identify 
		with it. In the short term we may wish to ‘escape’ from the reality of 
		that pain – feeling perhaps that we cannot bear it, that we don’t like 
		it, we don’t want it, we don’t deserve it – yet the Buddha teaches us to 
		experience the reality of that pain out of compassion for our long-term 
		well-being. We are not diminished by the experience of that pain.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Alienation</i><br>
		<br>
		Sometimes people mistake the teaching on mindfulness, confusing it with 
		a psychological state of being out of touch or being split off from 
		experience. A reason for making this mistake could be that there was a 
		lack of predictability in early-life experience. Given the mobility of 
		families these days and the various other forms of instability, children 
		often fail to learn a healthy, trusting way of relating to their peers. 
		If this disposition remains unaddressed such children grow into adults 
		whose underlying response to life is one of mistrust. Such individuals 
		don’t know how to fully surrender themselves into experiences of any 
		kind. It’s as if they’re standing back and looking at themselves living 
		life. ‘This is me doing this, this is me doing that.’ Spontaneous 
		self-surrender is not a possibility; there’s always that standing back 
		and watching oneself. <br>
		<br>
		This is not an uncommon perspective to have. Many people grow up with 
		such a sense of limitation, desperately wanting to be able to engage 
		fully with life but having a paralysing self-consciousness. Hence many 
		Westerners approach the Buddha’s teachings from the perspective of 
		feeling once-removed from life. And unfortunately they read the 
		teachings of mindfulness as endorsing this alienation. They try to turn 
		this dysfunctional aspect of their mind’s watching itself into a 
		spiritual practice. But certainly this is not what is being advocated. 
		Right mindfulness does not mean that we split off from our experience; 
		it means that we experience it more fully and accurately – without any 
		obstruction. Feelings of pleasure we really feel as pleasure. When we 
		eat a good meal, we know that there is pleasure. If we experience 
		pleasure and we are in a state of ‘not-knowing’ that we are experiencing 
		pleasure, we can be storing up problems for ourselves. The next time we 
		experience something that is not pleasant the ‘not-knowing’ state is 
		there again and this is where our suffering expresses itself. If we have 
		the presence of mind to receive experience as it is, undiluted, 
		uninterrupted, then everything can teach us. If we always stand back and 
		relate from our ‘safe’ perspective of ‘watching’ everything we are going 
		to find it difficult to learn.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Pleasure and pain in perspective</i><br>
		<br>
		We might think, ‘I am willing to be mindful of pain, but I don’t want to 
		have to spoil the experience of pleasure by being mindful of it.’ This 
		is a common misunderstanding of practice. If we hear what the Buddha is 
		saying clearly then we understand that when there is pleasure we just 
		‘know’ and don’t allow ourselves to indulge in it. Similarly when the 
		situation has changed and there is disappointment, we don’t get 
		overwhelmed by that either. In the practice of Right Mindfulness we 
		learn to not get thrown by the extremes of pleasure or suffering.<br>
		<br>
		This kind of ‘knowingness’ means that we are able to appreciate things 
		in new ways. We are learning to see and hear more deeply. We know for 
		example the impermanence of sensations, of perceptions, of feelings. 
		Somebody turns up whom you haven’t seen for a long time and it is such a 
		pleasure to see them. We feel it in the heart, in the body, feel a real 
		joy and delight at seeing an old friend – we experience the warmth and 
		friendship of good company. Now, if there’s right knowingness and 
		developed attention, then there’s also a not-getting-lost in the 
		experience. There is a silent inner knowing that eventually this person 
		that we’re so pleased to see will leave. We appreciate the reality that 
		the pleasure of this meeting is an impermanent condition.<br>
		<br>
		It’s difficult to talk about this subject without it seeming that 
		mindfulness somehow detracts from the experience. As if, when we meet 
		that dear friend again, being mindful of the transitory nature of 
		experience means that somehow we can’t fully enjoy the meeting. <br>
		<br>
		Often, when teaching about mindfulness, the Buddha would use another 
		word, sampajañña in Pali, in conjunction with sati. Sampajañña means 
		‘clear comprehension’. Each of our experiences – pleasant or unpleasant 
		– we understand with wisdom, knowing, ‘This experience will not last for 
		ever.’ It is important to get a feeling for the subtleties of the 
		quality of mind being encouraged. Mindfulness is a quiet knowing, a 
		quiet presence, and clear comprehension is the aspect that sees things 
		in perspective. The gentleness and balance of mind fostered in this 
		practice actually enhances the beauty of pleasant experience. And in the 
		face of that which is unpleasant, it equips us with the right kind of 
		strength to endure.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Free to see clearly</i><br>
		<br>
		An image that’s often given to help us develop the right understanding 
		of practice is that of a vast empty room with an open window, through 
		which a shaft of light is passing. In the shaft of light we can see 
		specks of dust which, although floating everywhere in the empty space, 
		are highlighted in the light. The shaft of light is the light of 
		attention. The vast empty space is the nature of the mind. The specks of 
		dust are the sensory experiences of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, 
		touches and mental impressions. The dust floats through empty space and 
		if there’s right awareness, right mindfulness, we see it in perspective. 
		Even if it’s gold dust we can’t afford to get it into our eyes, or we’ll 
		become blinded by it. If it’s foul objectionable dust we don’t get lost 
		in our reactions to that either. We know the dust for what it really is. 
		This is part of the function of mindfulness and clear comprehension: to 
		know things the way they really are, to see the relativity of things – 
		to see things in perspective. <br>
		<br>
		After hearing this advice, we may ask what use this teaching is with 
		respect to the bigger issues of the world. No doubt it is very subtle 
		and good, but how does it all relate to the fact that such and such a 
		country might be building up for another war with yet another foreign 
		country? What good does it do to know that sensory experiences are 
		specks of dust floating through the empty space of the mind? Well, this 
		practice can have a very positive effect on these wider issues. Thinking 
		about a build-up for a war can produce strong emotional responses. Not 
		only might we feel inner anxiety, fear or indignation, but we might also 
		have all sorts of thoughts directed outwards about the various leaders 
		of the countries involved. I’m sure we all know how enraging the subject 
		of politics can be. If we get caught up in such thoughts and feel 
		righteous, we find ourselves convinced by them. ‘We shouldn’t go to 
		war!’ we think; ‘War is bad, and generosity, kindness and peace is 
		good.’ If we don’t have these feelings with mindfulness and right 
		understanding then we lose perspective. If we get caught up in them, we 
		become them, and then our emotional reactions tend to be excessive. Our 
		thoughts, words and outward behaviour are determined by our stance, and 
		our lack of mindfulness leads to wrong action and wrong speech. It goes 
		like this: wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action. I mean 
		‘wrong’ here not in the moral sense but from the perspective of reality. 
		When things are like this, our passionate nature functions in service to 
		fixed and limited views, not in service to sensitivity and 
		understanding.<br>
		<br>
		If there is a cultivation of rightly informed mindfulness, we may 
		continue to feel indignant without any harm being caused to ourselves or 
		others. We can feel what we feel about the very real risk that there may 
		be a war in the near future. We can think whatever thoughts come into 
		our head about this or that leader. We can think what we think and feel 
		what we feel, but we know these thoughts and feelings as thoughts and 
		feelings – we don’t lose ourselves in reactions. We stay in a position 
		of optimum responsibility. We are not trying to stop feeling things or 
		thinking things. <br>
		<br>
		We might find in reflecting on the possibility of war that we think, ‘So 
		and so is a rogue and a monster. We should just nuke the guy, get rid of 
		him, get him off the planet. And we should execute all those 
		terrorists.’ Then we catch a glimpse of ourselves and react with, ‘Oh my 
		goodness, how could I be having such thoughts?’ We then start feeling 
		guilty and think, ‘I shouldn’t be having thoughts about wanting to harm 
		other people.’ If there is right mindfulness then even if we start 
		having biased, one-sided thoughts or the guilty thoughts that come 
		afterwards, we can let them be, without interfering with them. By 
		experiencing them in such a manner we can come to understand their 
		nature and what lies behind them. It is certainly not okay to act on 
		them and promote war or hatred, but when those thoughts arise we don’t 
		have to be upset by them. We don’t have to blindly react and try to 
		block them off. In fact we can learn from them. If they are received 
		with mature awareness they teach us how to empathise with those we might 
		otherwise call our enemy.<br>
		<br>
		One of the greatest teachings that I ever heard is that there is only 
		one thing that we need to be afraid of and that is the length of time it 
		takes for us to be mindful. I encountered this teaching in my first year 
		as a monk during a period of particularly intense struggle. Instantly it 
		made tremendously good sense to me; I believed it, I trusted it. And I 
		still do. <br>
		<br>
		It doesn’t matter what passes through that empty space; the nature of 
		those specks of dust is that they are all specks of dust. Right 
		understanding, right speech and right action will come, so long as we 
		remember to become rightly aware of our experience. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Balancing the faculties</i><br>
		<br>
		It is good to practise morality and to develop concentration. It is of 
		benefit to study wise teachings and to develop energy for practice. All 
		these spiritual activities are very important, but the Buddha made it 
		clear that mindfulness was supremely important. Without it we lose 
		balance, even with the virtue that we cultivate. If we are heedless we 
		can start to smell badly of becoming very good. If there’s mindfulness 
		then there can be a recognition of where we’re going out of balance. For 
		instance, if we are cultivating generosity, morality or kindness – or 
		any of the other forces of goodness – and we have mindfulness, then 
		there is alertness and recognition when conceit starts creeping in, when 
		the perception arises that ‘I’m generous’ or ‘I’m better than them’. 
		With mindfulness well developed we can see such taints developing. 
		Without mindfulness we might cultivate the virtues but lose perspective, 
		get lost and spoil the results of practice.<br>
		<br>
		With right mindfulness one recognises the relativity of experience. We 
		don’t have to take sides with our experiences; we don’t have to take 
		sides for or against pleasure or pain. Because we are experiencing 
		misery and a sense of failure it doesn’t mean to say that we are a 
		failure. We don’t have to become a failure because we are experiencing 
		the perception of failure. We may fear humiliating ourselves in public, 
		but without mindfulness we can really get caught up in that fear. With 
		mindfulness we can feel the feeling of fear of humiliation; or even feel 
		really worthless and disrespected and allow it to be – allow it to 
		highlight the next step we need to take towards freedom or balance. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Learning from criticism</i><br>
		<br>
		I received a letter today from a young monk I know who is currently 
		living out in Asia. He wrote that his whole practice these days is just 
		to feel what it feels like to be totally disrespected. He’s living in a 
		situation where he’s misunderstood, where people are not supportive of 
		him, and yet he’s committed to staying there for the three months of the 
		vassa. He can’t get out! He’s not starving or going without, but it is 
		humiliating him. In his letter he writes with equanimity and clarity, 
		“My practice is just learning what it feels like to feel disrespected.” 
		This is not a situation that one would set up for anybody, but learning 
		how to feel what it feels like to be disrespected will be invaluable. If 
		he becomes a respected monk and teacher, he will undoubtedly receive a 
		lot of praise, with people telling him how wonderful he is; but there 
		will be well-informed mindfulness of what it feels like to be respected. 
		He won’t get so lost in being respected.<br>
		<br>
		So it is with praise and blame. When people blame and criticise us, we 
		can ask ourselves what it feels like to be mindful of blame and 
		criticism. If someone praises us, telling us how wonderful we are, we 
		may lose our sense of proportion. They butter us up, we buy into it and 
		then they can manipulate us, and we feel conned and used. We don’t like 
		ourselves and we also resent them. But why did we get caught up in the 
		first place? Through a lack of mindfulness, a lack of perspective. So 
		the next time we are blamed and criticised, if we can be mindful and 
		feel the feeling of criticism, even feel what it feels like to fail, 
		then the next time we are succeeding or being praised we’ll be able to 
		maintain mindfulness in that too.<br>
		<br>
		Sometimes there is clarity and confidence and at other times there’s 
		chaos and confusion. If we give priority to the cultivation of 
		mindfulness, not to what’s passing through the mind, not to the specks 
		of dust, then, when we’re experiencing clarity, there’s a sense of 
		presence there too. If we are feeling confident and together, thinking, 
		‘I’ve really got it sorted’ then we can be aware that that’s what it 
		feels like right now. We are riding a wave but we remember the ocean. We 
		don’t become the wave. There can be clarity and order in our lives, but 
		we are aware that it’s not a sure thing, because everything is 
		constantly changing. The encouragement we have from the Buddha in 
		support of mindfulness is to reflect on the reality that everything is 
		changing. So when clarity and confidence changes, for whatever reason, 
		and instead there is chaos and confusion, disorder and lack of 
		confidence, we don’t get lost in it. We realise then that that was the 
		point of our effort.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Inhibiting unmindful tendencies</i><br>
		<br>
		Often when we are making an effort to be restrained in our attention, 
		not to just heedlessly follow things, we can’t really see the point of 
		doing it. It’s only later on that we realise the benefit. <br>
		<br>
		A young monk once went down to Bangkok to renew his visa and while he 
		was there he was asked to speak at one of the biggest universities in 
		Thailand. To his surprise he handled the talk and the 
		question-and-answer session with confidence and ability. On returning to 
		the forest monastery he asked Ajahn Chah, “How can it be that most of 
		the time when I am here my practice seems like rubbish? I feel like I am 
		wasting my time. Then, in a situation like that, I can come up with the 
		goods?” Luang Por Chah answered saying, “Our practice is like being a 
		gong. Most of the time you are just here, doing what you do, being 
		mindful of the simple things like sweeping leaves, pulling water from 
		the well, walking up and down on your meditation track, feeling like 
		nothing is happening. You are simply doing what you need to do to stay 
		mindful of the present moment. Then someone comes along and strikes this 
		gong and the sound is beautiful. However, we are not supposed to be 
		sitting there worrying about what our sound may be like.”<br>
		<br>
		When, in formal meditation we’re focusing attention on the sensation of 
		the breath, so many interesting things come along for us to think about. 
		‘I could be developing this, I could be building that. I could rewrite 
		that program like this,’ or ‘I could arrange for that deal’. While we’re 
		sitting in meditation, some of these creative ideas can seem so 
		inspiring and attractive. We are encouraged to learn how to say no to 
		them, to learn to inhibit our tendencies to follow them. Only when we 
		can choose not to follow our tendencies, can we know we are not 
		compelled and driven by them. Meanwhile, we inhibit the tendencies and 
		come back to the meditation object of the breath, the simple, clear, 
		neutral sensation of the body breathing. <br>
		<br>
		We want to think about things and follow our attractive, profound 
		thoughts so that we can develop them. Can we say ‘no’ to this tendency? 
		There is often a fear that manifests that if we say ‘no’ to this 
		profound thought or this beautifully, exquisite creative fantasy that is 
		just emerging, then it will die and we will lose our wonderful idea 
		forever. We’ll lose our intelligence and the consequences of that could 
		mean losing our self-esteem and dignity. We’ll lose our potential, we’ll 
		lose our superior ability to think profound thoughts. This is 
		traditionally understood as Mara coming in, threatening us, and saying, 
		‘Whatever you do, don’t practise restraint.’<br>
		<br>
		We shouldn’t ignore Mara. The Buddha didn’t ignore Mara; he just said, 
		‘This is Mara.’ In our case we can call such thoughts Mara, or we can 
		say, ‘There is a fear that I will lose my creativity if I inhibit this 
		tendency to follow this fantasy, but I don’t really know.’ We don’t 
		blindly or forcefully return to focusing on our meditation object. We 
		carefully restrain our mind, attending to it with patience and return to 
		the meditation object. We learn to say no to distracting impulses so 
		that we’re in the centre of our lives. This practice means that we can 
		choose to offer attention to the heart; we can give ourselves into 
		something without the mind being compulsively distracted this way and 
		that.<br>
		<br>
		Later we may discover that suddenly, without our expecting it, there is 
		a complex problem that arises in everyday life – a challenging 
		conversation or a difficult decision that needs to be made – but we’re 
		really right there. There is a strength of mind there that has come 
		directly and proportionately from our good practice. We may not have 
		seen that strength building up in the moment of restraining our 
		attention from following its habitual tendencies, but all that effort we 
		have made to restrain the mind – over and over again coming back to the 
		meditation object – has generated real strength of presence, strength of 
		mindfulness, sati. When we need that strength, it spontaneously and 
		selflessly manifests. <br>
		<br>
		In this way, we become inspired and encouraged to keep on cultivating 
		mindfulness in this discipline of attention. I use the word discipline 
		not in some brutal regimental way but in a sense of giving direction to 
		something that’s dynamic and alive. So long as our minds are still 
		swayed by deluded preferences, if we give no direction to our attention 
		then it will just go anywhere and everywhere.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Mindfulness and confidence</i><br>
		<br>
		With feeling, with skill and with sensitivity, we learn to apply the 
		discipline of attention, and so we discover for ourselves a naturally 
		increasing strength of mindfulness. Experiencing this brings with it an 
		increase of faith and confidence. Even when there are very difficult and 
		challenging situations, whether global, individual, inner, or outer, 
		there is a feeling of strength there with which we can meet those 
		situations. When we have developed mindfulness we won’t turn away from 
		them. We won’t necessarily like them of course, but our conditioned 
		likes and dislikes will no longer determine how we respond.<br>
		<br>
		If we discover this power of mindfulness, we won’t feel so threatened. 
		It’s like having a back problem; your back is giving out all the time, 
		and there are lots of things that you can’t do because of this weakness 
		in your back. You find yourself a good physiotherapist who teaches you 
		some exercises that give you just the right sort of strength in the 
		right place, and you find that you’ve got your confidence back again. 
		You can do things that you weren’t able to do before. As you experience 
		physical strength, so you feel confidence. So it is with spiritual 
		strength. Through the cultivation of the spiritual faculty of sati or 
		mindfulness, confidence and trust in life grows. </font></p>
