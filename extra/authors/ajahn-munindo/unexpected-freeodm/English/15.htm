		Let go of the past.<br>
		Let go of the future.<br>
		Let go of the present.<br>
		With a heart that is free, cross over <br>
		to that shore which is beyond suffering.</i><br>
		<br>
		Dhammapada, verse 348<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Not rarely, people ask, regarding practice, ‘How do I let go?’ There is 
		the perceived wish or need to let go, and yet regularly we feel unable 
		actually to let go. We read the Buddha’s teaching, in which it is 
		clearly and precisely pointed out that clinging is the cause of 
		suffering. We do a little meditation practice and very soon get to see 
		for ourselves that it really is the case that we have these habits of 
		clinging that keep tripping us up all the time. So we get the feeling 
		that we should ‘let go’. <br>
		<br>
		This reminds me of a refrain from a beautiful song from the late sixties 
		by The Mamas and the Papas called ‘Look Through My Window’. It goes, ‘… 
		and I know I should let go.’ I was eighteen or nineteen when I first 
		heard that song, and it was quite an inspiration for me. I was going 
		through, if not an epiphany, a period of deep inquiry, and these words 
		rang powerfully true. So this question that people ask, ‘How do I let 
		go?’ has been with me for a long time.<br>
		<br>
		We get stuck on memories, things that have clearly finished and gone. 
		They may well be very painful. We think, ‘If only I could let go of 
		this.’ We also get overly preoccupied with the future, imagining 
		pleasant or unpleasant things that may happen. We might think, ‘Only one 
		more week at work then I’m off to La Gomera! It will be so beautiful 
		there. There’s that particular beach I know where it never rains – it 
		will be so wonderful!’ The mind can be obsessed with beautiful things 
		which we imagine are going to happen in the future, but meanwhile we are 
		not here with what is happening now. This can create real problems for 
		us. <br>
		<br>
		If we are not fantasising, we are worrying about this imagined future. 
		Parents with young children can worry themselves sick with all the 
		horrible things that might befall them. While these beautiful, lovely 
		creatures are having a marvellous time mum and dad are making themselves 
		ill thinking, ‘What if this happens? What if that happens?’ They might 
		be dedicated Buddhist mums and dads, who say to me, ‘I protect them the 
		best I can but I am filled with worry, which I know doesn’t do any good. 
		I know I should let go but I can’t.’ <br>
		<br>
		As adults we can be obsessed with our bodies. There is no doubt about 
		it, our bodies are getting older and it is sensible to pay them due 
		respect – to eat well, to sleep regularly and so on. But a few little 
		things start going wrong, we get a little lump, and think, ‘Oh my 
		goodness, I’ve got cancer!’ We rush off to the doctor’s, but there’s 
		nothing wrong. We come home, but we keep worrying about our bodies, and 
		then feel ashamed about it. But what is it that makes the difference? 
		What is it that enables letting go? Just saying we should let go doesn’t 
		make it happen. <br>
		<br>
		In my early years as a monk, I remember that Ajahn Chah would teach 
		about letting go all the time. Some of his senior disciples used to copy 
		him and whatever question you asked they would say, ‘Well, just let go. 
		Let go. Just do it!’ – as if you could just let go as an act of will. As 
		if we were purposefully hanging on to things.<br>
		<br>
		It’s important to notice that idealising about how we should be is not 
		necessarily helpful. We know how we should be, so that’s good enough. We 
		can leave that aside and get on with looking a little deeper, feeling 
		how I can bring this about, and asking, ‘Why am I hanging on? What is 
		the experience of clinging anyway?’ This is the encouragement of right 
		mindfulness. Mindfulness is not about speculating about how we should or 
		shouldn’t be, but about cultivating a quality of attention that is in 
		the moment, investigating the reality of our experience. One of the 
		reasons we are clinging is because we don’t see that the clinging is 
		making us suffer. The Buddha said there are two reasons why you stay 
		stuck in this miserable affair of samsara: not seeing suffering, and not 
		seeing the causes of suffering. For those two reasons alone, not for 
		eighty-four thousand mysterious reasons. It’s not very complicated. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Taking Responsibility For Our Suffering</i><br>
		<br>
		A lot of the time we try to avoid suffering, and pretend we’re not 
		suffering when we are. On various levels, in subtle and gross ways, we 
		are carrying different forms of suffering such as fear, anxiety, worry, 
		doubt, regret and remorse. Even if we acknowledge that we are suffering, 
		it is not so easy and straightforward to see what the cause is. Some of 
		our habits are very deeply embedded. The habit of dwelling on resentment 
		is an example. If we haven’t truly enquired into this domain of our life 
		we can readily react to the feeling of unhappiness as if it were 
		somebody else’s fault. Even though we know we have this tendency, it’s 
		still very easy to fall into this particular pattern of reaction.<br>
		<br>
		One of the reasons it’s easy to dwell in resentment is because it’s so 
		difficult to admit that we are doing it. So we keep on with this habit 
		of thinking it’s somebody else’s fault. We think, ‘It’s got to be 
		something out there that’s causing this misery because it’s so painful, 
		and because I’m not such a bad person. Only a bad person would make me 
		suffer like this. It can’t be me.’ Well, bad news, I’m afraid. You don’t 
		have to be a bad person to make yourself suffer. All you have to do is 
		be a little unaware. <br>
		<br>
		So one of the reasons why we find it difficult to let go – why letting 
		go doesn’t happen – is this unfortunate habit of unawareness or 
		ignorance. When we feel resentful towards other people we don’t see that 
		we’re doing this form of clinging. We don’t see that it’s something 
		we’re actively performing. We live our lives thinking that somebody else 
		is doing it to us. In truth we are the authors of our experience.<br>
		<br>
		Added to this is the accumulated momentum of our habits. If we have been 
		hanging on to something for a long time, avoiding letting go by 
		indulging in some particular habit, a momentum will have built up in 
		this holding on. When we begin to counter our habits of denial or 
		avoidance by taking up meditation, it is this very momentum of our 
		habits that we experience as suffering. Even if we see through it and 
		know, ‘Oh, yes that’s what I do!’, the force of that habitual pattern, 
		built up over a period of time, means that our insight into the reality 
		of what is going on may not immediately seem to help change the 
		situation. Indeed, it is at this point that some people turn away from 
		the path. This contemplation is an encouragement, therefore, to resist 
		the inclination to believe in the disappointment that inevitably comes 
		with finding that there is nobody else to do our house cleaning. We 
		should instead take heart from the example of those who have done their 
		work and are enjoying the benefits. The inspiration of the Buddha’s 
		teachings and the wisdom of those who have practised them, can help to 
		encounter this disappointment. The strength that comes from such 
		inspiration gives us the courage to take a fresh and creative approach 
		to the forces of unawareness that we feel are driving us in familiar 
		patterns of behaviour that we would like to stop but do not seem to know 
		how to. <br>
		<br>
		When we do eventually get around to opening up to ourselves, it’s like 
		opening a door to a room we haven’t been in for a very long time. And it 
		can smell really bad – I mean really bad. We just don’t want to go in 
		there. But, you know, it’s a room in our house and it’s only a matter of 
		time before some guest comes along and decides to take a look. Then we 
		will have a problem. The reality is that we already have a problem – we 
		are just not aware of it. Although it smells bad, we’ve got to trust 
		that the only reason it does so is because it has not been aired out for 
		a long time.<br>
		<br>
		When we first open up the doors and windows and see the filth and the 
		mess, it looks like a huge task that we’ve got ahead of us. It can feel 
		like it’s just too much. The reason it feels that way is that we’ve put 
		so much energy into avoiding something for a long time. So we have to be 
		very careful not to assume that the way it looks is how it really is. It 
		can be daunting when we start to open up some of these rooms and get to 
		discover dimensions of ourselves that we were not expecting to find.<br>
		<br>
		As meditation deepens, we start to see aspects of ourselves that we 
		never even suspected were there. Or sometimes just with getting a little 
		older or being under some kind of pressure, external pressures or 
		pressures of health, we get in touch with things we vaguely sensed were 
		there, but never really saw the extent of. We think, ‘My goodness! How 
		am I going to deal with this?’ Again, we need to consider that the 
		reason it seems so much is that we’ve put so much energy into avoiding 
		it. <br>
		<br>
		Under such circumstances it is necessary to be very patient because 
		sometimes we have to endure a lot for a long time before some of this 
		momentum can be worn out. The momentum of clinging has created the 
		apparent reality of ‘This is too much. I can’t cope with this,’ and ‘I 
		won’t ever be able to let go of this.’ Well, don’t be too sure. Letting 
		go will happen. Try to consider that letting go is something that 
		happens; it is not something that we do. <br>
		<br>
		What is called for in practice is a willingness to bear with things, to 
		be honest with ourselves, and to wait until these things start to fall 
		away of their own accord. We don’t have to get rid of these things. 
		These things will fall away when we see the reality; when we see that 
		we’re doing the suffering. When we see that we’re the ones that are 
		actually creating this pain then automatically we will stop doing it. 
		But before we get to that point of seeing it we sometimes have to bear 
		with suffering for quite a long while and wear out – literally wear out 
		or burn out – the momentum of avoidance or denial, or the habit of 
		indulgence. Whatever the accumulated momentum is, we have got to endure 
		it until one day, much to our surprise, we’re still doing the same old 
		practice that we’ve been doing for goodness knows how long, but when up 
		comes the trigger we see it differently. When some sort of temptation to 
		get angry, greedy or afraid arises, suddenly we see it in a way whereby 
		it doesn’t get us. We aren’t fooled by it. It’s as though we have 
		acquired a new ability. It is not that we’ve done anything different to 
		make it appear differently. It is simply that the kammic momentum has 
		worn out. Though it might seem like a large heap of firewood will burn 
		on and on, there will come a point when there is no more fuel and the 
		fire will go out.<br>
		<br>
		Until we’ve been through such an experience, we are not familiar with 
		the dynamics of this process as it is happening within us. As a result 
		we can be deceived by the apparent enormity of the ‘problem’. This is, 
		where good friends who have walked the path a little longer or a little 
		further, can wisely and sensibly point out, ‘Just wait a while before 
		you decide you’re doing the wrong thing. Stay with it for a while and 
		perhaps it will change.’ Of course, it does change in time.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Fixed Identity</i><br>
		<br>
		Another reason that letting go doesn’t happen is that sometimes our 
		habits of clinging to various experiences – impressions, ideas or 
		feelings – become the structures of our own sense of who we are – often 
		quite irrationally so. Our identity is based on habits, and if these 
		habits are of denial or avoidance our personalities become irrational on 
		some level. Although we’re doing something that may be self-destructive 
		and better let go of, some old resentment or some old fear might prevent 
		us from looking at it fairly and squarely. Even though facing it may be 
		the right thing to do we don’t feel able to let go of our habit of 
		clinging because it’s become part of who and what we feel ourselves to 
		be. <br>
		<br>
		The rational mind, though it may recognise and be able to describe the 
		nature of our complex, cannot change the habit patterns by itself. To do 
		this requires a much more focused application of effort in terms of both 
		the practices of meditation and morality. Meditation is the means by 
		which we undo habitual patterns but it cannot be effective without a 
		foundation of morality. <br>
		<br>
		If we go into these practices with some determination and contemplate 
		what we’re stuck on – how it would be wise, useful and skilful to be 
		able to let go of this clinging business – what can come up, despite our 
		right contemplation, is a tremendous sense of fear. This often happens 
		for people on meditation retreats. We’ve just had a group of people 
		staying with us for the last week on formal retreat. Strict silence was 
		maintained and everybody was very committed to the practice and saw 
		genuine benefit from it. It wasn’t just a nice holiday. It was good hard 
		work, and for some people that good hard work meant encountering the 
		fear that comes up with the sense of loss of identity.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Falling Away of the False</i><br>
		<br>
		As we intensify attention and turn the light of awareness inwards, the 
		practice will dissolve that which is false. That’s how it works. When 
		the sun shines and the rain falls there are seeds in the ground that 
		will grow. Some of them are beautiful and some of them are weeds. It is 
		in their nature to grow given the appropriate conditions. I remember in 
		Thailand during the dry season the fields would be parched, with no 
		visible plant or animal life. It all looked so dead – the earth cracked 
		and hard. And then the rains would come and the land start to turn 
		green. The next thing you knew there were so many plants and little 
		creatures - even fish swimming in the puddles of water left by the rain. 
		How did these fish get there – without a river in sight that could have 
		flooded? When the sun comes after the rains have fallen, the causes are 
		there and life expresses itself. That is its nature. That’s just how it 
		is. Whether we like it or not that’s how it is.<br>
		<br>
		So it is with the practice. If we exercise restraint and practice 
		mindfulness and concentration, the false things that we’ve been hanging 
		onto will start to dissolve and begin to fall away. But we might start 
		to feel afraid as we become conscious of a sense of insecurity and a 
		certain loss of safety. A loss of predictability comes into our life 
		together with a sense of not really knowing who we are any more. When 
		encountering such fear, if we’re not properly prepared or supported we 
		can misinterpret it and think, ‘Oh, I must be doing something wrong.’ I 
		don’t know about you but I still find it very difficult when I encounter 
		fear not to assume that something is going wrong. Somebody is doing 
		something wrong and usually it must be me. There’s nothing around me 
		that is making me afraid, so it must be something I have done or am 
		doing wrong. <br>
		<br>
		That is not necessarily the case and it’s wise to prepare ourselves in 
		advance to withhold our judgement and our evaluation of the situation. 
		If we bear with the fear and wait, we may come to see that this fear is 
		what in the Buddhist terminology is called ‘One of the defences of 
		Mara.’ The closer we get to Mara the more annoyed Mara gets. Mara gets 
		really annoyed when we start practising with sincerity. Apparently, what 
		happens is the more dedicated and committed a meditator gets in seeing 
		through their delusion, the hotter Mara’s seat gets. Because he is 
		really miffed about our success in seeing through your apparent 
		limitations, he will send down his hordes to annoy, distract and tempt 
		us.<br>
		<br>
		At the back of the Dhamma hall here at Aruna Ratanagiri, there is a 
		mural by Pang Chinasai depicting Mara’s attach on the Buddha’s. Because 
		the Buddha was wholeheartedly committed to his practice and dedicated to 
		realisation, purification and generating benefit for all sentient 
		beings, he was able to stay true to his determination. Nothing upsets 
		Mara more. If you look on the right-hand side of the painting you see 
		the arrows that Mara’s hordes are firing as they ride towards him on 
		strange, hideous beasts. As the arrows get close to the Buddha they are 
		transformed into flowers which fall to the ground. And when the armies 
		pass the Buddha they are lost under the sea, and as they fall they hold 
		up flowers asking for forgiveness. <br>
		<br>
		When we remain resolved to see through the appearance of these forces 
		that unsettle or frighten us, we come to see that what we thought was 
		threatening us is in reality something that can help us. All the forces 
		within us, whether anger, greed, lust – even hatred – should be regarded 
		appreciatively as the raw energy which, once understood, fuels our 
		effort towards awakening. The arrows turning into flowers can be 
		considered a metaphor for what happens in our minds as we strengthen our 
		resolve and determination to see beyond our habits, to let go of that 
		which is false; to let go of our addictions, the false energy we’re 
		feeding on and the false identity that we’re holding onto. We trust in 
		reality and allow ourselves to receive these energies inside us 
		mindfully and sensitively, without acting upon them, and instead allow 
		natural compassion, clarity and wisdom to grow, without our attachment 
		and manipulations.<br>
		<br>
		The more determined we are to follow our heart’s longing to realise 
		truth, the more likely it is that we are going to encounter fear. Fear 
		of loss; fear of losing our friends; fear of losing our sanity – these 
		are common experiences. The fear of losing our friends is quite natural. 
		Sometimes you do lose your friends when you practise. You become less 
		interesting! You don’t go out drinking anymore. You don’t spend so much 
		money on clothes and getting your hair done. These things are 
		superficial; there’s nothing immoral about them, but they are not 
		exactly the most important things in life. You’re just disinclined to 
		invest in these kinds of concerns and so some friends fall away. <br>
		<br>
		When you first join a monastery, like the anagarikas living here, you 
		might still have lots of friends outside. But once you shave your head 
		and your eyebrows and start getting around in robes, a lot of your 
		friends, nice as they might be, tend not to get in touch anymore. You 
		can start feeling, ‘I’m going to lose all my friends.’ This can bring up 
		the fear of abandonment, of being left alone. If you become a novice or 
		a monk and you devote yourself to this training, during which you are 
		not making any money for yourself, the fear can come up of growing old 
		without friends, financial security, without career or home. Most of us 
		have these sorts of fears lurking just below the threshold of our 
		awareness, but in lay life we might avoid coming to an understanding of 
		these fears by reacting to them and investing our energy in ‘protecting’ 
		ourselves with money, friends, status and so on. As strange as it may 
		sound, the energy that is contained in fear is potentially of great 
		value to our well-being.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>The Fear of Losing Our Sanity. </i> <br>
		<br>
		When you get serious enough about practice and remain focused and 
		energetic in your efforts, some of the old mainstays of your sense of 
		identity are likely to dissolve. You can start to have unfamiliar ideas 
		about yourself and about life, even crazy thoughts. The thought may 
		arise, ‘Maybe I’m going mad!’ If we have never enquired into that 
		thought before, as most of us haven’t, it can trigger off a strong fear. 
		One reason for the fear of going mad is holding on to the self-view that 
		we’re not mad; grasping at the idea that we’re sane. The truth is we 
		don’t really know who or what we are, we just hold on to the ideas of 
		who and what we are. As we practise more and begin to resume our true 
		identity, these ideas become irrelevant and start to fall away. <br>
		<br>
		Most of us avoid the fear of going crazy or being mentally ill because 
		it’s so unsettling. When you see people who are clearly suffering from 
		some psychological disorder, it can be so disturbing that we choose to 
		avoid it. As a result we’re not familiar with that fear in ourselves. 
		Then when the fear then comes up, ‘Maybe I am going to go crazy,’ it can 
		appear genuinely threatening. We may ordinarily like to think of 
		ourselves as a fairly decent and normal sort of person, but when you go 
		on retreat you may start thinking instead, ‘Oh, my goodness. I’m not any 
		of these things. In fact I am not sure I will leave this place sane.’
		<br>
		<br>
		Wanting to know who we are is a very old habit. It has been there ever 
		since as a child we developed a self-image and fell for the mistaken 
		impression that this image was substantial and dependable. Well, if we 
		don’t want to look at these assumptions about ourselves, that’s where 
		our practice stops. We don’t get past that point. However, if we are 
		committed to getting to the bottom of all this confusion and sorrow we 
		don’t have to believe that we’re going crazy. We don’t have to believe 
		that we are actually under threat. We don’t have to worry about losing 
		all our friends. And we don’t have to dismiss the possibility of these 
		things being true either.<br>
		<br>
		The way things appear to be is just the way they appear. With 
		mindfulness we can allow them to be, including the feeling of loneliness 
		when it comes up. The way loneliness appears to be is that ‘I’m always 
		going to feel like this. I’m going to feel lonely, unloved and unwanted 
		for the rest of my life. If I stay as a monk and put up with this 
		miserable feeling of loneliness maybe I will be reborn in my next life 
		and become another miserable lonely monk. Then perhaps for another life 
		and another life. Perhaps for all eternity.’ <br>
		<br>
		When we get lost in a state of fear, it feels like an eternity. That’s 
		why people talk of hell being eternal. Of course, no conditioned 
		phenomena can be eternal. If there is a hell – and probably there is – 
		it’s not a permanent condition. But when we get stuck, get locked into 
		fear, it feels like, ‘I’m going to be lonely forever’ or ‘I’m going to 
		be full of resentment forever.’ We can’t let go of these things if we’re 
		committed to our habit of holding. However, if we do, little by little, 
		gradually prepare ourselves, and practise regularly in a sensitive, 
		mindful way then the strength of mindfulness can sustain us in a hellish 
		situation. <br>
		<br>
		These apparent realities, such as fear and loneliness, can be received 
		into our awareness, but we have to be willing to allow them. The 
		Buddha’s teaching of how to come to the end of suffering requires us to 
		have this willingness. When we allow these experiences to happen without 
		turning away from them, it doesn’t make them feel anything other than 
		what they are. Fear is still fear, loneliness is still loneliness, and 
		disappointment always feels disappointing. It is the way we relate to 
		these experiences that changes. <br>
		<br>
		So, to answer the question, ‘How do I let go?’: It is certainly not a 
		matter of ‘I should let go’, of trying to make ourselves let go. Instead 
		we turn our attention inwards towards our feelings and thoughts, and 
		intelligently, carefully, consider, ‘What is the experience of holding 
		on? Do I really want to hold on?’ Part of us wants to hold on and part 
		of us doesn’t. If we can become aware of both aspects and consider them 
		patiently in a feeling manner, it is my experience that this brings 
		about letting go. ‘I’ didn’t do it, but it happened. To not investigate 
		this dynamic leaves us vulnerable to heedlessly taking sides, struggling 
		with thoughts about ‘Do I or do I not really want to let go,’ 
		desperately trying to make the right choice.<br>
		<br>
		Also, consider, ‘What am I getting out of holding on to this? Am I 
		getting anything at all useful out of it?’ Some of the reasons we are 
		holding on to things are thoroughly unexpected, worn-out ideas. We hold 
		on to things that are not relevant anymore. So instead of idealising and 
		saying, ‘Well, I should let go,’ I would encourage us all to consider 
		the experience of holding on and not being able to let go; to feel it 
		directly without any resentment or idealising. Just to receive the 
		consequences of what we are doing and allow natural wisdom to teach us. 
		When we look at it long enough, little by little, a new momentum begins 
		to emerge – the momentum of letting go. <br>
		<br>
		As our faith in this approach to the path of practice strengthens, faith 
		becomes a condition for further letting go. As faith and mindfulness 
		work together we know for ourselves that we are safe to trust this path.<br>
		<br>
