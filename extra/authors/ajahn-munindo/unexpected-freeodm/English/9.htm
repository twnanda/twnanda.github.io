		There are those who discover they can leave behind confused reactions<br>
		and become patient as the earth; <br>
		undisturbed by anger, unshaken as a pillar,<br>
		unperturbed as a clear and quiet pool.</i><br>
		<br>
		Dhammapada, verse 95<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Question: How do I balance social action with dispassion and acceptance 
		of things as they are? A sense of injustice is often the motivational 
		force to act and persevere. Given that it is my job to challenge core 
		practice in organisations how do I balance these different aspects of my 
		practice? Not to act feels like collusion in wrongdoing, plus I’d 
		probably lose my job.<br>
		<br>
		Ajahn Munindo: It is true that we can feel caught in a conflict between, 
		on the one hand, actually doing something about the ills in society that 
		we live in and, on the other, the way we hear the Buddha’s teaching 
		about cultivating dispassion. It feels like a paradox – a painful 
		paradox – and it seems there’s some sort of contradiction. We hear the 
		teachers telling us, ‘It’s just the way things are’. Perhaps you feel 
		angry and frustrated about this. Perhaps you say, ‘This isn’t good 
		enough.’<br>
		<br>
		The world we live in is full of injustices, and there are things going 
		on that are simply wrong. Most of us have a clear sense that there is 
		right behaviour and wrong behaviour. What we struggle over is how to 
		honour the values we hold at the same time as deepening our 
		contemplations. What I find helpful is to appreciate that the 
		consideration of the rights and wrongs of the world – the outer world – 
		is happening in one particular dimension of our minds. Yet there are 
		other dimensions in which we are not necessarily thinking in such a 
		discursive manner. Probably you have experienced what it is like when 
		the mind is silent and yet there is still a clear knowing operating. In 
		this dimension of our minds we are called to consider in a different 
		manner. Here we can learn, for example, to recognise the underlying 
		views that we hold – the views that inform a lot of our more surface 
		thinking. We need to be aware at these deeper dimensions so that there 
		can be a readiness to respond confidently in any given situation. Much 
		of our formal practice is concerned with creating suitable conditions 
		for becoming acquainted with the underlying views and tendencies of our 
		minds.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Compulsive judging mind</i><br>
		<br>
		I was speaking earlier today with somebody about an underlying tendency 
		that most of us have – what I call the ‘compulsive judging mind.’ There 
		is a tendency in the mind to be always taking sides for or against 
		things. It is like a sports commentator incessantly going on: ‘This is 
		good, this is bad; this is right, that is wrong; you’re doing well; 
		you’re making a fool of yourself, you should be like this; you shouldn’t 
		have said that, he shouldn’t have said that, he should have said this, 
		she should be here…’ It is an endless stream of ‘shoulds’ and ‘shouldn’ts’, 
		and the tendency to think like this has been there for so long that we 
		probably don’t know how all-pervasive it is. <br>
		<br>
		When we are on a retreat we have the good fortune of practising in an 
		ultimately simplified situation. There are almost no distractions. It is 
		conducive to the inward focus of our attention, its becoming 
		increasingly subtle through the medium of quietness. If we pay careful 
		feeling-attention in the right way and at the right time, we can 
		identify this tendency to judge everything, and begin to look at it 
		objectively. <br>
		<br>
		To take an example, let us say a desire arises in the mind to seek out 
		praise or recognition. You feel it is about time you were recognised for 
		your talents and qualities and you wish to hear someone praise these 
		attributes. So you think, ‘I’ll just go off and perform in front of 
		somebody so that they give me a little praise.’ Now, perhaps I’m putting 
		things a little crudely, but the fact is, our minds often work in such 
		ways. So this desire arises, but then when you recognise it you start 
		thinking, ‘Oh how awful! That shouldn’t be happening; I should be beyond 
		wanting affection and praise. I’ve been practising all these years and 
		I’m still having this kind of state of mind.’ <br>
		<br>
		Once when I was complaining to Ajahn Chah about how unfortunate I was 
		with all the health problems I was having, hoping to gain some sympathy, 
		he said to me sternly, “If it shouldn’t be this way, it wouldn’t be this 
		way.”<br>
		<br>
		Everything that happens in our life happens as a result of causes. There 
		are causes for every phenomenon that arises, inwardly and outwardly, so 
		without doubt those phenomena should be there. There are causes for you 
		to think those thoughts. There are causes for you to feel those 
		feelings. The curious thing that we neglect to understand is that our 
		problem is not that we are having such thoughts – the causes for which 
		lie in the past over which we have no control – but that we are judging 
		ourselves for having them here and now. By saying to ourselves, ‘I 
		shouldn’t be thinking these thoughts or feeling these feelings,’ we are 
		putting obstacles in the way of our self-knowledge. We are, in effect, 
		polluting our awareness.<br>
		<br>
		So in order to understand what is going on at the deeper level of our 
		minds we can use a retreat situation to get subtle and refined enough to 
		go into that dimension and see it in a different way to that which we 
		are used to. If we are careful and skilful enough we can learn how to 
		undo those habits which are a cause of affliction for us. <br>
		<br>
		This is an example of addressing the underlying view we have of life; 
		the way that we approach life. If we go through life with a compulsive 
		judging mind, it keeps us in a divided state. We will always feel like 
		there is a challenge; we have no inner peace. This tendency has been 
		conditioned so deeply into us that we think it’s natural. But it isn’t 
		natural; it is something that we have learned to do. And, fortunately, 
		we can unlearn it so that it no longer consumes our energy in such an 
		unproductive, unhelpful way.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Judgement-free awareness</i><br>
		<br>
		There is a church in the middle of Newcastle that has painted on the 
		front doors, ‘Hate all Evil. Love all Good.’ If you were brought up with 
		that sort of conditioning, as many of us were, you will inevitably have 
		been led to this inwardly divided state. According to this teaching – 
		which I am sure is entirely contrary to the Way of Jesus – God loves 
		good and hates evil. The good ones he embraces and takes up to heaven 
		where they have a good time forever, and the bad ones he chucks into 
		hell where they have a bad time forever. With this kind of conditioning, 
		when, in the face of recognising our faults we want to be virtuous, we 
		start playing God; we set up this almighty tyrant in our minds that’s 
		sitting in judgment all the time. We end up eternally taking sides for 
		and against ourselves – and it is terrible, it tears us apart. <br>
		<br>
		The good news is that taking sides is not an obligation – we don’t have 
		to do it. We don’t have to follow these compulsions. With simple, 
		careful, kind, patient attention we can recognise them as a tendency of 
		mind. They are not the mind itself! They are not who and what we are. 
		And having seen them, little by little, we are less caught up in them. 
		As long as we don’t start playing their game by judging the judging 
		mind, saying, ‘I shouldn’t be judging,’ we take away the counter-force 
		which gives these tendencies their vitality. We come to know the judging 
		mind as it is. The judging mind is just so. There is nothing inherently 
		wrong with the judging mind. Its ability to evaluate and discriminate is 
		an important part of the intelligence that we as human beings use for 
		our safety and survival. The problem is that its influence has become 
		disproportionately large in our day-to-day living, and it never wants to 
		be quiet! Through careful feeling-investigation we can come to see this 
		hyperactivity for what it is and allow the discriminative function to 
		resume its proper place. We experience whatever is happening with our 
		full attention but with calmness and some degree of equanimity. In each 
		moment that we see the judging mind objectively – just as it is – we 
		purify the underlying view that we have of life.<br>
		<br>
		In the deeper dimensions of our being there’s this kind of work to do. I 
		would suggest that if we have the agility to move in and out of these 
		various dimensions we will become adept at addressing very complex 
		issues. In our daily life we can usefully set time aside, perhaps thirty 
		minutes each day, to sit in formal meditation, and this agility will 
		grow. Even ten minutes of well-spent sitting, being still and going back 
		to the basic feeling of a total non-judgemental relationship with life, 
		to perfect receptivity to the moment, can be of great benefit. Call it 
		meditation, call it contemplation, call it whatever you like! It is a 
		way of putting some time aside to value this part of life, to keep this 
		faculty alive. And I trust that, as we emerge into the more mundane 
		workaday activity of our lives, in which we engage with people in 
		situations and make decisions and so forth, we will find that we have a 
		firmer foundation. The decisions we make will be informed by an 
		underlying clear view. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Opening to paradox</i><br>
		<br>
		And so, even though there can appear to be a paradox or conflict, 
		somewhere within us we know that it’s an apparent paradox, and that with 
		mindfulness and restraint we can allow it to be, without feeling driven 
		into a reactive way of trying to solve it. This is why it’s so important 
		to purify our awareness of compulsive judging tendencies. So long as 
		we’re still habitually judging everything that comes up into our 
		awareness, chronically judging, ‘I shouldn’t feel this way, I should 
		feel that way,’ we are significantly obstructed in our ability to 
		contemplate anything clearly. Even if our thoughts go in the opposite 
		direction, if we’re having a good experience and the mind is rejoicing, 
		‘This is wonderful! This is how it should be I’m doing great now,’ if we 
		don’t see this running commentary for what it is, then it’s only a 
		matter of time before we swing to thinking, ‘It shouldn’t be like this,’ 
		and become lost again.<br>
		<br>
		So long as we’re caught up in the compulsive judging mind, our capacity 
		for meeting the paradoxes of life with clarity is very limited. 
		Paradoxes will inevitably arise in our lives as human beings and if we 
		haven’t discovered the heart’s capacity for judgement-free awareness 
		then we are likely to turn towards outer forms for support. We will 
		remain overly dependent on conventions and techniques, club membership 
		and beliefs. But with a real interest in developing our hearts and minds 
		and freeing them from the type of conditioning that I have been 
		describing, we won’t shy away from what others might call a dilemma. We 
		will approach it with a view to finding the awareness that can receive 
		the experience – an all-embracing, non-reactive awareness. When we come 
		across a paradox, instead of automatically turning to some external 
		structure, or clinging to some particular point of view to make us feel 
		safe again, we actually engage with the paradox in a manner that 
		increases the capacity for accommodating frustration. Frustration leads 
		us to finding that increased capacity. Frustration is our friend in 
		practice. If we get that message early on, it’s a great blessing. 
		Because sooner or later all of us, not just once but probably a good 
		number of times, will reach a point of utter impossibility, where it 
		seems there’s nothing we can do about our situation. We reach a point 
		where we feel all our techniques have been exhausted; we can’t fix it 
		and yet we can’t stop trying either. <br>
		<br>
		Ajahn Chah wrote a letter to Ajahn Sumedho after he’d been in Britain 
		for a year or two. In this letter he wrote: “The Buddha Dhamma is not to 
		be found in moving forwards, nor in moving backwards, nor in standing 
		still. This, Sumedho, is your place of non-abiding.” That’s a truly 
		helpful teaching. The numerous forms and techniques that we are taught 
		have their place, but they are limited. If we don’t understand the 
		relative function of forms, and we give them too much value, we run the 
		risk of feeling betrayed by practice. We might think, ‘I’ve been keeping 
		my precepts and meditating. I’ve been going to the monastery and going 
		on retreat, but I just can’t help feeling betrayed and let down by it 
		all. Buddhism has failed me and well, it’s a foreign religion anyway, I 
		shouldn’t have messed with it in the first place!’ I’ve heard this said 
		on more than one occasion. The truth of the matter, however, is that 
		Buddhism is not a foreign religion. As you encounter Buddhism, you will 
		undoubtedly find conventions and cultural forms that are Asian in 
		character, but the outer forms are not the point. The point of Buddhism 
		is truth. And truth is neither Asian nor Western. <br>
		<br>
		As we become acquainted with this possibility of living life without 
		always taking a position on everything, a correspondingly increased 
		sense of freedom emerges. To the degree that awareness is liberated from 
		compulsive conditioning there is an increase in the feeling that we have 
		more room in which to move. And with that we can think more clearly and 
		feel more sensitively. The mind is not always afraid of being wrong or 
		obsessed with being right. We have learned that those two go together 
		and feed off each other. This somewhat more liberated mind can welcome 
		difficulties and frustrations, seeing them without judgment as the 
		natural way of the world. Such awareness knows where and when to 
		skilfully apply structures and when to trust in the spirit of practice.
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Unobstructed wisdom</i><br>
		<br>
		Regarding this specific question of knowing just when to act and when to 
		sit still and go inwards, we will find that gradually we develop the 
		possibility of allowing such conflicting concerns into the mind, 
		acknowledging them fully, as they are – with all the power and passion 
		contained in them – and waiting until our own clear confident resolution 
		appears. And we will not feel compromised in the process. We will feel 
		that we are doing what we can do. We won’t feel driven to get it right. 
		In our hearts we know we already want to get it right so we can trust in 
		that. With strong developed awareness we are free to let the tension 
		build. In fact, the energy generated by allowing these two apparently 
		conflicting possibilities simultaneously into awareness, is the energy 
		that slowly but surely drives ‘me’ out of the picture.<br>
		<br>
		The view I find most constructive is that the wisdom that knows the 
		right action in every situation is potentially already here within us. 
		Unobstructed wisdom is not something that we have to get. Such wisdom is 
		the natural activity of our hearts when obstructions have been removed. 
		I believe we can afford to trust it. What creates obstructions is the 
		sense, that comes out of fear and confusion, of ‘me’ and ‘my’ trying all 
		the time. It sounds strange to say, but we need to learn to genuinely 
		respect that which challenges us. Patiently allowing utterly frustrating 
		dilemmas to be present in our here-and-now, judgment-free awareness – 
		this is the path of purification. This practice will gradually lead us 
		to a very different, yet perfectly natural, way of viewing the 
		difficulties of our lives.<br>
