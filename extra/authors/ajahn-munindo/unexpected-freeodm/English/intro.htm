		So often we are trying to follow the Buddha’s teaching with the idea of 
		becoming free from something – free from our desires, our personality, 
		our anger, our suffering. It might then come as quite a surprise, when 
		suddenly, in the middle of our striving to attain or get rid of 
		something, we find our heart opening like a window, revealing to us the 
		spacious vista of an unexpected kind of freedom: the freedom to fully 
		meet ourselves as we are right now; the freedom to fully experience all 
		the situations and emotions that seem to be obstacles to our happiness, 
		without having to believe in or follow their apparent messages. What 
		allows us to abide in that unexpected freedom, finding stillness and 
		clarity in the eye of the storm, is a spacious, embracing awareness of 
		the present moment, which for its liberating qualities lies at the heart 
		of the Buddha’s teaching. This collection of talks is formed around the 
		theme of this potentially limitless awareness.<br>
		<br>
		The inspiration to put this book together originated with a series of 
		talks given by Ajahn Munindo at the beginning of the millennium in New 
		Zealand. In those talks he characterised a practice centered on trust in 
		a non-judgmental awareness of the present moment as ‘source-oriented’ 
		practice, contrasting it to ‘goal-oriented’ striving. I was living at 
		the monastery in Wellington where the talks were given and it was a 
		great relief for me to hear his eloquent exposition of a theme I was 
		struggling with myself, feeling intuitively drawn to a source-oriented 
		approach but at the same time keeping a half-hearted commitment to 
		goal-striving. A predicament which led me into years of confusion in 
		which I vainly tried to synthesize and reconcile the two approaches in 
		my own practice. Finding myself encouraged by one of our senior monks to 
		follow my own intuition was quite a relief, freeing up a lot of energy. 
		Part of the newly kindled enthusiasm went straight into the effort to 
		get the talks edited. With the help of a few good friends we merged them 
		into one text called ‘We are all Translators’, the second of this 
		collection. There was a particularly strong incentive for me to do this, 
		having seen how many other people, particularly Westerners, shared the 
		same response to the talks or the theme developed in them. And the 
		reception of the talk seems to have proved its relevance, as it has now 
		been reprinted in several languages. <br>
		<br>
		Soon after coming to Aruna Ratanagiri, the monastery at Harnham, in the 
		north of England, where Ajahn Munindo is the senior incumbent, a number 
		of other talks sprang to my attention that seemed similarly significant, 
		adding perspectives and themes that felt like cornerstones of Ajahn 
		Munindo’s way of living and presenting the Dhamma: ‘When we fall in 
		Love’ with its appreciation of how to harness all of our enthusiasm for 
		life into our practice; ‘What is Renunciation?’ explaining the need for 
		a proper container in which our passions can be transformed; and ‘Prayer 
		and Devotion’, concerning the engagement of our heart’s longings and 
		aspirations in a way that usually gets little attention in Western 
		presentations of the Theravada teachings. Then, over a period of a few 
		months I heard Ajahn Munindo give a whole series of talks illustrating 
		the application of present-moment awareness to various difficult 
		situations and emotions, culminating in the ‘The Power of Paradox’. In 
		this talk he succinctly formulates the essence of a source-oriented 
		approach to practice: “Patiently allowing utterly frustrating dilemmas 
		to be present in our here-and-now, judgment-free awareness - this is the 
		path of purification.” With those talks fleshing out the theme opened up 
		by ‘We are all Translators’, the idea of a book took on more definite 
		shape, and after some initial hesitation (“Do you really think these 
		things are worth printing?”) Ajahn Munindo warmed up to the idea. 
		Finally, through the bequest of his good friend Sue Warren, who passed 
		away in 2003, there arose the opportunity to print this book and 
		dedicate it to her dear memory.<br>
		<br>
		In the first talk of the collection Ajahn Munindo shares his experience 
		of his early years as a monk in Thailand and his relationship to and the 
		teachings received from his first teacher, the late Ajahn Tate. The book 
		then moves on to the theme of respectfully translating the teachings and 
		the form of the inherited tradition into what is meaningful and workable 
		for us. This is a task that, as is explained in ‘We are all 
		Translators’, we have to face individually if we want to receive genuine 
		benefits from our practice. In his own efforts to meet this challenge, 
		Ajahn Munindo remains faithful to the instructions on awareness he 
		received from his first teacher: to “realise the difference between the 
		contents of the heart and the heart itself.”<br>
		<br>
		The main body of the book develops the theme of this awareness, the 
		heart itself, its inherent freedom and its relevance for receiving and 
		transforming the various passions and problems arising in our life. The 
		aim is to show how it is that in this cauldron of awareness, if our 
		connection to it is strong, stable and clear enough, all obstructions 
		can be melted down into their raw energies which then become available 
		again to manifest in ways that are wholesome and beautiful. As the Ajahn 
		points out in ‘Getting to Know our Emotional Household’, this is 
		essential, as “we need all our energy for the work of purification”, and 
		whatever part of it we try to deny or repress for too long will go 
		underground and eventually turn against us. <br>
		<br>
		The talks towards the end of the book offer reflections and practices 
		that try to provide a supportive framework to hold awareness in its 
		place, investing it with the strength needed to undertake its 
		transformative work. This arrangement of the talks, then, follows a 
		certain logic; however, it should be possible to open the book at any 
		page and find some relevant reminder or a fresh perspective on the 
		challenges we face in our practice. <br>
		<br>
		The talks were given at a variety of venues – at Aruna Ratanagiri 
		monastery, during either the regular Sunday evening meetings or lay 
		meditation retreats, during travels to meditation groups in Britain as 
		well as in other countries – always to a lay audience, mostly with 
		monastic Sangha presence, often addressing specific questions, and so in 
		general trying to address topics of concern for both monastic and lay 
		practitioners. They have, at least in part, been edited extensively to 
		adapt them to the written format, to avoid repetitions or to clarify the 
		argument where it seemed helpful. <br>
		<br>
		The quotations at the beginning of each talk are taken from Ajahn 
		Munindo’s own rendering of the Dhammapada, published by River 
		Publications. They introduce the theme of the talk and pay homage to the 
		Buddha by offering a reference to the Pali scriptures, the most ancient 
		record of his teachings. Thai and Pali words (apart from Buddha, Dhamma, 
		Sangha and some proper names) have been italicised where they appear in 
		the first instance in each talk. Their meaning can be looked up in the 
		glossary.<br>
		<br>
		It was a great pleasure to work on this book with the dedicated help of 
		so many friends. We would particularly like to thank Thomas Jones and 
		Glenn Langdell for their very competent editing of the talks, the 
		various proof-readers, especially Ajahn Candasiri, and Soph Moeng for 
		offering his type-setting skills.<br>
		<br>
		At times we felt that our enthusiasm for trying to include as much 
		material as possible, trying to cover all the points we found 
		particularly relevant to the overall theme, would result in a rather 
		longish volume. Which reminds me of a story about the Spanish artist 
		Pablo Picasso. Once Picasso was visiting the Louvre in Paris with an art 
		critic friend. As they were standing in front of one of Rafael’s 
		masterpieces, expressing their admiration, the art critic pointed to one 
		of Rafael’s ethereal renderings of a Greek goddess, and ventured to say, 
		“But Pablo, don’t you think he painted this arm much too long?” which, 
		technically, was true. However, Picasso immediately retorted straight 
		from the heart: “Ah, no – such a beautiful arm can’t be long enough!”<br>
		<br>
		I hope you will enjoy reading this book as much as we enjoyed producing 
		it.<br>
