		Seeing the false as the false<br>
		and the real as the real,<br>
		one lives in the perfectly real.</i><br>
		<br>
		Dhammapada verse 12<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		As our retreat draws to a close and we start talking again, several 
		people have mentioned how during the retreat they’ve had to encounter a 
		lot of fear. Although on the outside there was nothing to be afraid of, 
		and we couldn’t have been with a nicer and safer group of people, this 
		didn’t stop fear arising. Amongst all of us here, I wonder if there’s 
		anybody who hasn’t experienced fear at some time on this retreat? I 
		wonder what our reaction to that fear was? Was there anyone amongst us 
		who didn’t ascribe a negative value to that fear; who didn’t say to 
		themselves that it was wrong to feel afraid? <br>
		<br>
		So who is it that says that it’s wrong to feel afraid? When we 
		experience fear, and we hear a voice within us saying we shouldn’t be 
		afraid, who is saying that? This is an important question and I would 
		like this evening to look into it.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Listening carefully</i><br>
		<br>
		When we first hear this question, we might hear the emphasis as, ‘Who 
		says it’s wrong to feel afraid?’ as if we could find out who it is that 
		says ‘it’s wrong’ and teach them to say that it’s okay. This would be an 
		understandable kind of reaction. When we find something disagreeable, 
		our initial reaction is often to try and find the responsible agent. But 
		what happens if we change the emphasis of the question to ‘Who says its 
		wrong to feel afraid?’<br>
		<br>
		If we feel afraid, I would suggest that what is called for is to feel it 
		fully, to feel fully afraid. We need to understand that this same 
		character who says ‘It’s wrong to feel afraid’ also says that it’s wrong 
		to feel all sorts of other things. He or she is endlessly judging and 
		condemning. This is the one that is getting off on the world, consuming 
		the world, feeding on the world through praise and blame. <br>
		<br>
		The Buddha said that to feed on praise and blame is like feeding on 
		other peoples’ spittle, on that which is better spat out or vomited up. 
		This compulsive condemning mind feeds on taking the position of judge, 
		on judging things as right, wrong, good or bad. Part of us really enjoys 
		being so superior in handing down this judgement.<br>
		<br>
		This same one starts laying on the praise when things are going well and 
		we find our experience of life agreeable. A voice says, ‘You’ve really 
		got it together; you’re doing really well. In no time, all sorts of 
		people will want to listen to your pearls of wisdom. You’re flying; 
		you’re on the way home.’ This character feeds on praise and blame, gain 
		and loss, success and failure. This is the part of us that the Buddha 
		said was a slave to the world. The energy it lives on is false and 
		unsustainable. <br>
		<br>
		We don’t need to feel bad when we come across this way of getting false 
		energy. We don’t need to condemn it. We just need to see it for what it 
		is. That which sees this false way is itself real. The Buddha said, 
		‘Seeing the false as the false, we attain to the real; mistaking the 
		false for the real, we stay stuck in the false.’ When we see ourselves 
		consuming false energy, which is what we are doing when we are being 
		judgemental of our fear, we see that tendency for what it is. Finding 
		identity in judging and condemning is a very limited identity, and it’s 
		also an exhausting identity. It means always having to try to succeed 
		and win. We will always have an enemy to try to get rid of. By contrast, 
		the one who walks the way beyond right and wrong and good and evil 
		abides as the awareness which sees, which listens, which knows, and 
		which receives all experience willingly.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Fear is just so</i><br>
		<br>
		So our practice is a way of moving out of the tendency to indulge in 
		habits of condemning, of being for or against our fear or whatever else 
		it is we’re experiencing. Our practice is that of assuming the 
		disposition of one who receives into awareness that which is, silently 
		listening, and feeling freely. Fear is just so – no judgement. Fear, in 
		the beginning means, ‘I feel afraid.’ But if we keep listening to it and 
		feeling it, the ‘I’ falls away and there’s just feeling fear. Fear. And 
		there is awareness, a presence in the middle of our experience, not 
		pushing nor pulling, not accepting, not rejecting, neither for nor 
		against, neither not for nor not against. But it’s not that I then have 
		a new-found fixed identity as awareness, because I can’t own this 
		presence. Any feeling of wanting to own and be secure we can also simply 
		receive.<br>
		<br>
		Then we start to recognise that our desire and fear go together, that 
		they are inextricably joined. When we see this connection between desire 
		and fear we don’t want to get lost in desire any more because we see 
		that whenever we get lost in wanting we’re building up fear for the 
		future. Fear is the other side of desire. If ‘I’ am caught in desire, 
		what ‘I’ don’t see is how much I’m caught in the fear of not getting 
		what I’m desiring. If we live freely with our feelings of wanting and 
		desiring and wishing, if we live seeing clearly, knowing accurately, 
		then the fear of not getting what we want is just that, it’s just so, 
		it’s not a problem. But when we grasp at the desire to get, we also 
		grasp at the fear of not getting, even if we don’t see it. We wonder 
		where so much of our fear comes from. Why is it that more extravagant 
		people, people who live more opulently, have more fear? Because they 
		follow desire more. Fear and desire go together. As we work on being 
		true with one, we discover a more true relationship with the other. If 
		we want to be free from excessive desires then we need to look at how we 
		feel about fear. When we feel afraid, we receive the fear into 
		awareness. If it’s really strong fear, which it can be at times; if it’s 
		terror even, or panic, at least let’s try and remember to inhibit the 
		tendency to say this is wrong. We’re not saying that it’s right; we’re 
		not trying to feel good about it. But we’re bringing into relief those 
		voices within us that are saying that it’s wrong to feel afraid. It’s 
		not wrong to feel afraid, it’s not right to feel afraid. When we feel 
		fear we want to feel it fully, freely, without judgement. We are neither 
		for nor against fear.<br>
		<br>
		As we open into a broader quality of awareness, and we are able to 
		receive our experience of fear into that awareness, we can study it 
		clearly. We can study it deeply, in our own way, not through reading 
		books or merely through thinking about fear. Thinking doesn’t do us any 
		good at all when we really feel afraid. We can listen, feel, observe the 
		whole body-mind contraction that we experience as fear.<br>
		<br>
		Fear is not a thing; it’s an activity. Fear is the activity of 
		constricting and contracting the heart energy. When we are challenged 
		with some dangerous physical situation, the blood vessels in our body 
		constrict and contract, we tense, we get more energy, and we can move 
		out of that situation fast. That’s what’s supposed to happen, that’s an 
		appropriate reaction. But often the same thing happens inappropriately 
		for some imagined reason or threat. We develop very complex patterns of 
		avoiding the knowledge that we’re doing this fear. We somehow feel a 
		victim of it. And in our state of helplessness the only thing we are 
		able to do is judge it as wrong, decide that we’re failing. But it is 
		possible for us to expand beyond these contracted reactions with our 
		well-developed radiant awareness, free from judgement and even from the 
		need to understand. Awareness is simply willing to receive accurately.<br>
		<br>
		When awareness outshines these shadowy reactions of denial and 
		avoidance, the dynamic activity of fear that we are doing reveals 
		itself. We feel it happening, we feel ourselves doing this constriction 
		that obstructs the feeling of life, that obstructs the possibility of 
		beauty, of intelligence, of love. Maybe we come to see that the 
		possibility of loving is always here. In fact, it’s the most natural 
		condition. We see that the only thing that obstructs it is this 
		contraction of fear that we’re performing out of unawareness. And maybe 
		if we come to see this for ourselves, we give up trying to become more 
		loving, we give up trying to not be afraid. It’s a waste of time trying 
		to be more loving. It’s like trying to make money when you’ve got a 
		fortune in the bank. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Why pretend about reality?</i><br>
		<br>
		If we see that we’re obstructing the heart’s radiance, then we can begin 
		to feel what’s behind that tendency to obstruct that we’re habitually 
		involved in. If we do this, then that tendency to obstruct is what we 
		become interested in, not some new improved image of ourselves that 
		we’re trying to synthesize. A non-judgemental, non-condemning, all 
		forgiving, radiantly loving, thoroughly acceptable, agreeable, rounded, 
		nice, improved me appears as a altogether unattractive fantasy; both 
		unconvincing and uninteresting. What is interesting, what is genuinely 
		attractive, is the possibility of experiencing the reality of being in 
		the centre of our own reactions. Not pretending to not be afraid, not 
		pretending to not get off on praise, not pretending to not dislike 
		blame. But when for instance we feel blame and we dislike it we receive 
		it fully. Why pretend about reality? When we’re feeling good about being 
		praised and appreciated, we know it as it is. When we’re feeling afraid 
		we say, ‘Yes, I feel afraid.’ We feel what we feel until there’s no 
		distance, no split within us, and we’re one with what we’re feeling. <br>
		<br>
		In attempting to do this there is the real risk that we tap into more 
		passion than we know how to contain. And if this is the case then we 
		must acknowledge that we need to develop more strength of containment, 
		more stability of character. We humbly recognise it, without trying to 
		push past, without trying to overcome anything, without trying to bypass 
		any stages or any experience, without trying to become enlightened or 
		something. We own up to the limitations that we are experiencing, and we 
		come back to exercising the discipline of attention, engaging with 
		interest in the practice of mindfulness of breathing. We want to do this 
		not because it’s good or it’s right or it’s what some expert told us we 
		should do but because we want to have the strength and the skill to be 
		able to surrender ourselves into the reality that at this stage we 
		intuit is at least possible.<br>
		<br>
		If we approach our samadhi practice with this kind of wholehearted 
		interest then it won’t lead to fighting ourselves, it won’t lead us into 
		heedless judging of ourselves when we come across our limitations. It’s 
		inevitable that, as we intensify the heart feeling through such 
		exercises as observing silence and focusing the mind, we’re going to 
		move through areas of experience that we don’t feel so complete in, so 
		whole in or so safe in. It must be that way. Fear can be a healthy 
		reaction as we move into dangerous territory. To say that we feel afraid 
		doesn’t mean to say that we’re inadequate. Ajahn Chah used to say, ‘Well 
		if you’re going to cross the motorway to get to the other side, you 
		should be afraid; it’s dangerous!’ So let’s be careful if we come across 
		reactions in the face of fear such as, ‘You’re wrong, you’re failing 
		because you’re feeling afraid.’ <br>
		<br>
		Let’s see if we can listen with greater patience and deeper willingness.</font></p>
