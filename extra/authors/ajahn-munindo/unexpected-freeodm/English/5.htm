		There is no fear if the heart is uncontaminated<br>
		and the mind is free from ill-will.<br>
		Seeing beyond good and evil, one is awake.</i><br>
		<br>
		Dhammapada verse 39<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		I have been asked to talk about falling in love. The way I want to 
		approach this topic is from a consideration of love as that which 
		happens in our heart when all fear falls away. Perfect love is the 
		absence of the heart-contraction experienced as fear. Now, can we 
		contemplate this absence as presence? <br>
		<br>
		<i>Love as Undivided Attention</i><br>
		<br>
		What does it feel like to be loved? What does it feel like to be loving 
		– as it is happening? To receive love from another is to receive 
		somebody’s undivided attention. They’re not preoccupied with anybody or 
		anything else; they have forgotten themselves and are wholeheartedly 
		attending to us. There’s a tremendous beauty, richness and fullness in 
		so receiving the heart of another. <br>
		<br>
		If we were to consider the experience of our own undivided attention 
		directed inwards, we would come upon ‘one-pointedness’, the essence of 
		formal meditation. Cultivating this one-pointedness is our samadhi 
		practice. In samadhi we experience a sense of profound beauty and 
		fullness, an incomparable aliveness directly related to the quality of 
		attention involved. However, as important as the cultivation of this 
		unified inner state may be, this evening’s question is about the same 
		undivided heart-quality directed outwards, towards another person. <br>
		<br>
		It’s natural that we want to know the truth about love. It is such a 
		mysterious and unfathomable experience, and yet our hearts yearn to 
		fathom it. Various objects and situations can draw us into this state of 
		being undivided. If we’ve consciously experienced our ability to offer 
		such attention, we know how it feels in the company of another 
		individual, but we might also have experienced it unexpectedly on a 
		mountaintop or alone out on the ocean. There might also have been 
		occasions when we felt lifted into an altogether different reality 
		through proximity to a particular individual who has fully realised the 
		heart’s capacity for being loving. Simply being in their company might 
		have induced us into a state of love that we had not known before. In 
		these various ways it happens that conditions sometimes conspire to free 
		us from fear; and when fear ceases, when for some magical reason fear is 
		not happening, love is.<br>
		<br>
		Having become aware through personal experience of this tremendous 
		quality of undivided attention, it becomes possible for us to enquire 
		into how, where and when attention becomes divided. Our attention is 
		usually divided, and we soon recognise how difficult it is not to be 
		divided – not to be taking sides for and against our experience. It’s 
		not easy to make ourselves be loving; in fact we can’t do it; ‘I’ can’t 
		make myself be loving. Being loving happens. However, we can, through 
		developing an interest, direct ourselves towards an awareness of the 
		divided state; we can investigate it and become familiar with its 
		dynamic. As we make this investigation, we start to find that we can 
		undo the compulsion to be divided. Accordingly, as we are freed from the 
		compulsion to be divided in our lives, we begin to realise the heart’s 
		capacity to live free from fear. Slowly but surely we once again uncover 
		the natural ability to be loving, and in doing so we emerge from 
		reactivity into responsible living.<br>
		<br>
		<i>The Wound of Separateness</i><br>
		<br>
		To say that we uncover a natural ability might make it sound like being 
		divided is all wrong. It was not all wrong. In childhood we grew 
		gradually from a state of undifferentiated identification with our 
		parents and the sensual world into a perception of separateness, or 
		relative selfhood. The child development theorists describe how an 
		individuated sense of being a separate somebody is constellated by about 
		the age of seven. By that stage a personality of sorts, an ego, has 
		become established together with the perception of ‘me’ and ‘you’ and 
		‘the world out there’. Along with these perceptions come all ‘my’ 
		desires; from the age of seven onwards there’s a lot more substance to 
		the demanding of a child. Accompanying this developing ego, there’s ‘my’ 
		ability to say no to ‘you’ when you want something from ‘me’; there’s 
		more solidity, and the ideas of ‘my rights’ and ‘my boundaries’ develop.
		<br>
		<br>
		This development of ‘my way’ is natural and necessary for us as humans. 
		But it is very useful to understand how, as this momentum increases, 
		there’s a diminishing capacity for abiding in the happiness of the 
		undifferentiated state – the state of simply being at one with what is 
		happening. The pleasure and freedom of ‘at-one-ment’ that we knew as 
		children become less and less accessible to us as we grow up.<br>
		<br>
		Then as we approach early adolescence we start to look for ways to 
		escape the discomfort of this perceived separateness, with its agonies 
		of loneliness and dividedness. And, not surprisingly, around this time 
		we have our first experience of falling in love. Something happens, we 
		don’t quite know what it is, but we become incredibly interested in 
		somebody else – and it’s not mum or dad! It’s magical, it’s frightening, 
		and there’s an excitement and enthusiasm that promises to free us from 
		all our unhappiness.<br>
		<br>
		So we have fallen in love, but we are still carrying the wound of 
		separateness that occurred in childhood. That wound means that there’s 
		no longer the opportunity simply to be one with life. Now we find that 
		there’s ‘me’ and ‘you’ as well as the ‘world’. When we fall in love 
		there is the first major disturbance of our separate identity, and the 
		first hint of the task ahead of us: as if out of instinct we 
		passionately desire to return to at-one-ment. ‘How do I return to that 
		beautiful state I used to be in, where there wasn’t a care in the world? 
		I feel obstructed, I feel cut off, I feel only half alive…’<br>
		<br>
		In presenting this particular perspective on falling in love, I am not 
		saying that this is all there is to it. This is one pathway of 
		contemplation into an important and complex area of our lives. Falling 
		in love can appear extremely attractive to a person at one time yet 
		terrifying at another. What is called for is a way in which we can ask 
		the most challenging questions of our hearts while feeling free and able 
		to listen to the response. <br>
		<br>
		Initially it might appear that by following our passionate desires we 
		will get what we want; and what we want after all is to be happy. We 
		think that by following our desire to be happy we will become happy. We 
		believe that there is such a thing as true happiness and that falling in 
		love is a way to get it. Most of these beliefs and thoughts are totally 
		unconscious at the time. <br>
		<br>
		The difficulty which we encounter during these initial efforts is that, 
		as we follow the impulse to gratify desire, the momentum of ‘my way’ 
		increases. ‘I’ feel more and more that ‘I’ must have that which ‘I’ long 
		for. With this comes a corresponding intensification of the fear of not 
		getting the object of my desire. The increase in force of the compulsion 
		of ‘my way’ gives rise to an absolutely equal increase in the fear of 
		not getting my way. With the increase in the force of the fear of not 
		getting ‘my way’ there is the painfully diminished capacity for simply 
		being loving. <br>
		<br>
		Tragically for us, we don’t notice this happening. All we know is that 
		the passionate longing is increasing and that we feel trapped. It is 
		rare that we receive the kind companionship of others who would guide us 
		through our adolescent struggles to wisdom. Hope for true love and 
		lasting meaning increases yet the clouds of loneliness roll in and our 
		hearts grow cold.<br>
		<br>
		Our life continues to unfold in myriad ways. But now we’ve got this 
		divided consciousness – we believe strongly in right and wrong and good 
		and bad. We have the ability to make judgments about how things should 
		and shouldn’t be, and about how I should and shouldn’t be. And it 
		doesn’t stop. Years go by; the momentum of it all seems to increase, and 
		yet there is still this inkling that somehow this business of love is 
		terribly important. We write poetry about it, sing songs about it and 
		from time to time we experience something that we call ‘falling in 
		love’. Yet we are not freed from our increasingly chaotic dividedness.<br>
		<br>
		In fact everything about us becomes divided, even our professional 
		lives. We talk about ‘being at work’; there’s who we are at home and 
		there’s who we are at work. Even if you’re a professional meditator, a 
		monk or a nun, there can be dividedness. I hear people talk about ‘the 
		real practice’, which means there must be the unreal practice. The real 
		practice, they say, is when we’re meditating. They say that when we’re 
		doing ‘the real practice’ – that is when we’re on retreat – there are no 
		problems. As soon as we start talking and relating to others, doing work 
		and so on, then we get all these problems. But if there is our real 
		practice and our unreal practice, then we are living in a state of 
		fragmentation; relationships, talking to people and being at work appear 
		as obstructions to well-being. Who is responsible for that division? 
		Where does the idea of real practice and unreal practice exist? In our 
		divided minds, in our divided hearts.<br>
		<br>
		Sometimes we’re sitting in meditation and the mind is not how we want it 
		to be. Perhaps we’re filled with longing for intimacy that is causing an 
		inner struggle as we sit there on our cushion. If we look carefully, 
		we’ll find that there is a voice that says, ‘It shouldn’t be this way, I 
		shouldn’t be like this.’ Where does that division of what should or 
		shouldn’t be exist? It exists in our own divided minds, our own divided 
		hearts. We are the ones who are setting conditions up against each 
		other. We need to know this.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Falling in Love</i><br>
		<br>
		It’s possible that if there is an absence of love in our lives, we try 
		with our divided minds to become more loving. We think of our unloving 
		characteristics as things that we have to ‘fix’. However, when we look 
		at what is – without any sense that it should be some other way – we can 
		sense this very tendency to divide ourselves off from what is. If we 
		approach our lives in this way, cultivating undivided attention to the 
		present moment, we are capable of being loving in each moment. <br>
		<br>
		If we live this way, and one day a person appears, and that special 
		magic happens whereby fear falls away and the beauty that we call loving 
		manifests, then maybe we won’t divide our hearts and minds and start 
		struggling to hold on to this experience. Maybe we won’t spoil it; we 
		will be loving, we will delight in and be strengthened and even 
		transformed by the intensity of that experience. The intensity of that 
		beauty and that joy has the power to transform the habit of selfishness. 
		The momentum of ‘my way’ can be dissolved, by the radiant warmth of love 
		with all of its intensity and all of its enthusiasm and all of its 
		beauty, undenied. <br>
		<br>
		However, for most of us, most of the time, this spontaneous capacity for 
		loving is not the reality that we live with. We find that we are not 
		able to abide as that loving reality, and so it is that we fall in love. 
		What happens then, when we fall in love? The intensity and enthusiasm of 
		that moment when fear falls away and when the natural, undivided state 
		becomes conscious, turns our lives upside down. From the point of view 
		of ‘me’, from the unawakened personality’s perspective, that enthusiasm 
		is totally threatening; it feels like it could shatter me. It becomes 
		intolerable – we can’t sleep, can’t eat and feel we’re being driven mad. 
		If we’re not suitably prepared for such intensity then the very pleasure 
		of loving itself triggers the habit to grasp and contract. The pleasure 
		is so beautiful that I feel I can’t help but want it to last. The 
		momentum of ‘my way’ is thus expressed as a default mechanism of 
		narrowing attention. Instead of opening in wonder at the beauty of the 
		experience and simply being it, we default to the momentum of ‘my way’, 
		to the ‘How can I have it?’<br>
		<br>
		Pointing this out is not to judge that momentum, but to help us consider 
		it and recognise it as a habit. To try and grasp at pleasure is not an 
		obligation, it’s a habit; it’s a choice that we make, and therefore we 
		can also choose to exercise the heart’s ability to inhibit that 
		contraction.<br>
		<br>
		When we contract around desire, grasping its object, thinking, ‘I want 
		to make this pleasure last,’ we condition the arising of the exactly 
		equal and opposite experience of ‘I’m afraid it won’t last.’ These two 
		experiences, of wanting the pleasure to last, and fearing that it won’t, 
		go together, like the front and back of the hand. We can’t have one 
		without the other. The sadness of this situation is that by grasping the 
		desire to make it last we lose the loving. We lose the loving in its 
		pure, natural form; the contracted heart no longer has the capacity to 
		contain our enthusiasm and so it leaps out and lands on the other 
		person.<br>
		<br>
		This is the subjective experience as the open-hearted beautiful state is 
		lost. Because of the habit of desire and the consequent fear, the 
		heart-energy leaps out and lands on the object – whether it’s a thing in 
		a shop that we feel we must have, or another person, or an ideal, or a 
		state of mind. Assuming that it’s another person, the consequence of 
		this leaping-out is the thought, ‘I can’t live without you.’ And that’s 
		true; ‘I’ can’t live without ‘you’, because I don’t have my heart 
		anymore; you’ve got half of it at least, so I’ll do anything to have you 
		– that’s what the heart feels and what the mind tends to believe. <br>
		<br>
		The unawakened personality cannot live without the other, for it feels 
		like death, though from the perspective of the awakened personality all 
		this would be seen as a state of diminished responsibility. Now, to say 
		this is not to diminish the experience; we all have the experience and 
		we all have to learn from it. But we should also recognise that in this 
		experience we betray ourselves and project our hearts’ passion and 
		enthusiasm onto another object or another person. Subsequently we have 
		to suffer the consequences of having betrayed ourselves. Believing that, 
		‘I cannot simply trust my own heart’s capacity for loving, so I will 
		project it onto you and expect you to carry it for me,’ we fall in love. 
		This is losing ourselves, and there’s an intoxication in this 
		experience. If we make a contract with each other – two unawakened 
		personalities deciding to collude with this delusion – then, when the 
		two of us get together in equally deluded states, it can feel like one 
		whole. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Love and Transformation</i><br>
		<br>
		Often I am asked whether it is possible to deepen practice in the 
		context of a committed relationship. My hesitation to say much about 
		this is not because of a view that progress on the path towards 
		realisation can only be furthered in the context of monastic life; such 
		fixed views scare me. But since I don’t have the experience of living in 
		relationship with one other person with any degree of long-term 
		commitment, I can’t presume to know. Just as I wouldn’t rely on someone 
		without many years experience to teach me how to live the celibate 
		renunciate life, I don’t wish to instruct others how to live their lives 
		as householders, only to encourage asking questions of themselves. I 
		believe that all of us, whatever our lifestyle commitment, can use every 
		situation we find ourselves in to deepen practice. <br>
		<br>
		One thing I have heard from some who view their partnership as practice 
		is that there is as much, if not more, to learn from falling out of love 
		as there is to learn from falling in love. What is essential is 
		commitment and interest in going beyond the initial high. I have heard 
		various lay teachers, who know about this business from their own 
		experience, that inevitably every relationship reaches the point where 
		at least one of the partners feels, ‘I made the wrong choice.’ And it is 
		precisely at that point that the relationship becomes really interesting 
		as an aspect of spiritual practice.<br>
		<br>
		There are ways of contemplating the dynamic of being loving so that we 
		can prepare ourselves to benefit from our susceptibility to falling in 
		love. As the possibility of the Way dawns on us, we can start to see 
		that it is wisdom that calls us to prepare ourselves for such wild 
		encounters with life. Experiences such as falling in love appear 
		threatening, at least on some level – they don’t just threaten to 
		destroy our ego, our subjective personality (they do that for sure); 
		they also threaten to ruin our lives. If you’re a monk or a nun and you 
		fall in love, and you’re not prepared for it, the consequences can be 
		very difficult. Similarly, if you’re married and you fall in love with 
		someone other than the one with whom you have made a commitment, the 
		consequences can also be very difficult. But we can prepare ourselves, 
		so that we don’t have to be afraid of it happening; we don’t have to be 
		afraid of the intensity.<br>
		<br>
		If we contemplate in this manner, we can ask ourselves, do I want to be 
		able to withstand the tension that arises as a consequence of an as-yet-unawakened 
		relationship with my own heart-capacity? When we fall in love, what’s 
		really taking place is that we are challenged to own up to the 
		consequences of our limited way of engaging with experience. We feel 
		like saying, ‘I can’t handle it, I can’t handle this,’ but we can decide 
		to handle it, to say ‘I’m interested in learning to handle this; I’m 
		interested in learning to handle all of my heart’s enthusiasm for life; 
		I’m interested in being loving, fully, purifying the heart’s capacity 
		for being loving.’ If we’ve investigated and considered this matter, and 
		then decide to exercise this choice, we are already preparing ourselves, 
		so that when the passion arises, fear, contraction and limitation is not 
		the default, but instead an interest in the reality which is unfolding 
		takes its place. We’re interested and enthusiastic because we see the 
		potential that such energy has for dissolving the rigidity of our frozen 
		hearts. It feels impossible from one perspective, for sure; from the 
		perspective of the ego, it’s definitely impossible; but from the 
		perspective of facing the Way, it’s a profound power for transformation, 
		and it does not have to become an obstruction. It can deepen our 
		commitment to being free to live all of our life as it comes to us and 
		goes from us, without fear.</font></p>
