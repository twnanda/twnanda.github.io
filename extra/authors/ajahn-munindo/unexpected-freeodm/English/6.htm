		</font>But the worst stain of all is ignorance.<br>
		Be purified of this and you are free.<br>
		</i><br>
		Dhammapada verse 243<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Can we contemplate together what happens when we get caught in blaming?
		<br>
		<br>
		Several times recently I have heard used the expression, ‘a culture of 
		blame’. Strangely, some of those using this expression appear to feel 
		that someone ‘out there’ is responsible for the existence of this 
		culture. <br>
		<br>
		From the perspective of practice we begin our investigation into blaming 
		by looking first for what it is that we ourselves are contributing to 
		our suffering. Once we are able to acknowledge our part, we are then in 
		a position to perceive the causes for the arising of this suffering more 
		accurately. <br>
		<br>
		Let us consider some examples. Last week, the driver of the JCB, working 
		on the building site which will become our retreat centre, dug up the 
		mains water-pipe, so that the monastery and surrounding houses were 
		without running water for four hours. There was quite a bit of blaming 
		going around in response to that. Some thought it was the driver’s fault 
		for not being more careful, others the project manager for not doing 
		sufficient research, some the site manager for leaving the workers to 
		carry on without supervision. There was even the suggestion that the 
		neighbours brought it upon themselves with the bad kamma they had 
		created by being so difficult!<br>
		<br>
		Then there has been all the talk about the terrible weather we are 
		having. The blame, it has been suggested, rests with those responsible 
		for global warming. And that can’t be Britain because she is too small a 
		country. It must be the Americans; four percent of the world’s 
		population generating twenty-five percent of the pollution! It’s easy to 
		blame the Americans. <br>
		<br>
		But where does this blaming get us? On a superficial level we can feel 
		better if we have someone to blame; we can feel right when we think we 
		know who is wrong. Being able to label people as responsible also deals 
		with the anxiety which comes from always wanting to know things are 
		under control. But does having someone to blame – and that someone might 
		be ourselves – free us from suffering? It gratifies something 
		momentarily, but is that the same as finding satisfaction? Now we have 
		created an enemy, which is another kind of suffering. And if it is 
		ourselves we have blamed then we become even more hurt and inwardly 
		divided than we were before.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Right motivation</i><br>
		<br>
		Surely our motivation to uncover causes for our problems is a natural 
		interest in being free from suffering – and there isn’t anything wrong 
		with that. Yet the kind of blaming we’re discussing does not come from 
		pure-hearted interest. In these cases the healthy impulse to seek out 
		the causes for suffering became poisoned by the untamed passions. Our 
		life energy experienced as our human passions, flared up and invaded 
		hearts and ignited minds. <br>
		<br>
		This life-energy is not in itself either good or bad; it is neutral. But 
		the way in which it manifests gives rise to perceptions of good and bad; 
		it is in how we relate to our perceptions that we can begin to take 
		responsibility for our suffering. How we view our experience determines 
		whether we live our lives blaming whenever we suffer, or whether, when 
		suffering arises, we are strengthened in our commitment to being free.<br>
		<br>
		So what can we do? In our contemplation of falling in love we 
		investigated how, in the height of intensity and aliveness, we might 
		tend to default to old ways of contracting the heart-awareness, thereby 
		losing the beauty and freedom of ‘being loving’. We considered how this 
		happens as a result of our inability to accommodate the fullness of life 
		with all its energy. This inability arises out of habitual fear, which 
		results in our becoming chronically limited in our capacity for 
		whole-hearted living. Instead of being liberated by that which promises 
		to give us ever-lasting happiness, we end up spoiling it and becoming 
		dependent on each other through attachment.<br>
		<br>
		Isn’t it similar with blaming? When we don’t get what we want, or get 
		what we don’t want, or lose that which we enjoyed having, we suffer the 
		pain of disappointment, sorrow and despair. The energy flares up and we 
		start to burn. Our initial reaction turns into indignation and rage. As 
		the storm intensifies and moves upwards into our heads, we start 
		imagining where we can place the blame. Through a perceived inability to 
		hold the pain – like a volcano that cannot be contained by the earth’s 
		crust – our energy bursts out and lands on the object of our blame. 
		Because the pressure of frustration feels intolerable, we project our 
		heart-energy out. <br>
		<br>
		Just to notice this is to see the very point where things can change. If 
		we have prepared ourselves for these reactions it is possible that 
		instead of becoming more rigid in our clinging to what we want, we open 
		up to accommodate the passions. To prepare ourselves with this kind of 
		contemplation is to increase the likelihood of mindfulness being there 
		when we need it. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Right preparation</i><br>
		<br>
		We all know what it is like to become caught up in the passions, so we 
		do not need to wait until it happens to do something about it. Right 
		preparation is the way to protect ourselves from our own harmful habits. 
		By establishing in advance this kind of understanding, we are much less 
		likely to fall into old ways. The force of habit is inhibited by 
		mindfulness. This kind of considered restraint is not the same as a 
		blind repression that we might fear will lead to the energies returning 
		in a more potentised form in the future.<br>
		<br>
		In exercising such restraint we create the conditions for seeing through 
		the appearance of suffering. We develop the capacity to overcome that 
		state of inertia which binds us into the humiliating condition of 
		‘losing it’ time and time again. When we experience the state of 
		fearlessness that we know as love, we are tempted to grasp at its beauty 
		– believing that this will make it last. But with right restraint 
		insight arises, outshining old painful habits, and love is purified. By 
		comparison, when we are hurting, we tend to react by rejecting, seeking 
		someone or something to blame. But shooting our passions out onto an 
		external figure makes us weak and dependent. If we can stay with the 
		energy long enough, refusing to succumb to the temptation of trying to 
		release ourselves from it, the energy builds up until the walls which 
		held us imprisoned and chronically limited, crumble. The awareness we 
		occupy opens up. Being restrained with informed awareness is the work of 
		transformation. Mindful holding back is the dynamic that frees us.<br>
		<br>
		After consciously going through such an expansion of awareness, we know 
		for ourselves that we are not hopeless victims of our inner fires. A 
		transformation of the wild passions through awareness means that we feel 
		altogether differently towards their flaring up. We find that there is a 
		little more space for them – at least until we find ourselves limited 
		again. They are no longer seen as enemies against which we must forever 
		brace ourselves. From this point onwards we can view suffering 
		differently. The teachings that tell us that mindfulness of suffering 
		leads to freedom from suffering become true in a new way. Henceforth 
		when pain such as disappointment arises, we have a sense that inhibiting 
		the impulse to blame is the way itself – not torturous endless 
		endurance. Allowing the pressure of the passions within us to increase 
		while staying steady and focused in an interested manner is the path to 
		a new understanding. In other words, our suffering, held with such a 
		view, becomes the key that opens the doors that have kept us feeling 
		locked in.<br>
		<br>
		There is a further point we should consider, and that is how, when we 
		taste the fruits of our practice and delight in the spaciousness of 
		increased awareness, we are at risk of being infected by the blight of 
		conceit. We might feel, “I have transformed my anger.” This is to lose 
		ourselves again. The energy that actually liberated us out of the 
		cramped space of a contracted heart is not the energy of our deluded 
		personality. It is not ‘me’ that did it. It is nature. It is Dhamma. 
		Laying claim to it is the habit of grasping raising its head once more. 
		But we can learn from this too. We come to see more clearly how the 
		unawakened ego continually seeks to find security by grasping. The 
		impulse to awakening, however, only seeks the truth: there is no freedom 
		in clinging. <br>
		<br>
		I hope this contemplation helps us all learn to be careful.</p>
