		Although it is difficult to cross over the storm-swept sea of passion,<br>
		those who live in accord with the well-taught Way, arrive at the beyond.</i><br>
		<br>
		Dhammapada, verse 86<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Question: Does prayer have any place or any part to play in Theravada 
		Buddhism?<br>
		<br>
		Ajahn Munindo: I am happy this question has been asked. Although prayer 
		might appear to belong to forms of spiritual practice quite different to 
		this one, it is a dimension of spiritual work that personally I feel we 
		are not wise to dismiss. I can say for myself that for many years now 
		hardly a day has gone by when I haven’t offered up some prayers. 
		Although I may not have sat in formal meditation every day, I never 
		forget my prayers. In other words I consider prayer life to be 
		essential. I can’t imagine living this life without a conscious 
		engagement in this way. <br>
		<br>
		How does one talk about something so mysterious and intensely personal? 
		It is difficult to say what prayer is, or how we learn about it. During 
		my Protestant upbringing there was a general assumption that everybody 
		knew how to pray. We sang hymns, I heard the Bible readings and the 
		prayers during services, but nothing was said about how to enter into a 
		conversation with the ‘divine principle’. We were told, ‘Ask and ye 
		shall be given.’ But how exactly were we to do the asking?<br>
		<br>
		More recntly I had a conversation with a Christian monk who came to 
		visit us. He lives the life of a hermit just north of here, in the 
		Scottish Borders. We talked about the joys and sorrows of the monastic 
		life, and about the people who came to visit him at his humble abode. I 
		asked, “Do you ever teach them how to pray?” He gave a brilliant reply. 
		“Oh no,” he said, “prayer is not taught – it is caught. It’s like a 
		disease. You catch it off someone else who has it.” <br>
		I immediately knew what he was talking about, having lived around 
		traditional Theravada Buddhists for five or six years in Thailand. There 
		was something that one might call a prayerful attitude towards practice, 
		which I do feel that I ‘picked up’ there. <br>
		<br>
		I wasn’t altogether conscious of this dimension when I loved there, but 
		a few years later, when I was on solitary retreat in this country and 
		having a very difficult time, I discovered that there was a voice within 
		me which wanted to speak out. During this period I had put myself on a 
		solitary retreat for two months. Other than the fortnightly recitation 
		of the rule, which I was obliged to attend, I wasn’t going to see 
		anybody for two months. I locked myself in a small room at the top of 
		Chithurst House and covered the windows with tracing paper so that I 
		received daylight but no view of the outside world. All this served the 
		purpose of bringing about great intensity, which I thought of course I 
		could handle. I had a few things to learn. One of those things was the 
		value of prayer. The only things comparable to prayers that I had as a 
		part of my Buddhist practice were the reflections that we do in the 
		morning and evening chanting. When I started to give voice to the verses 
		that I had been reciting daily for years, I found I was speaking them 
		with feeling. Something within was quickened and uplifted, so that I was 
		able to say these things and mean them. ‘May I abide in well-being, in 
		freedom from affliction.’ ‘May I be free from suffering. May all beings 
		be free from suffering.’ To say those things with conscious intent was 
		truly gladdening. I remember it inspired me to look a little further and 
		in so doing I began to come up with my own words. That was a significant 
		step on a path towards a meaningful prayer life, which I recognise with 
		hindsight to have been something of importance that was missing from all 
		the spiritual exercises that had been a part of my life as a monk up to 
		that point.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>The Dynamics of Prayer</i><br>
		<br>
		To find our own words to express our innermost wishes can be of great 
		significance when it comes to finding out how to take responsibility for 
		our own hearts. It opens a pathway whereby we connect with that which is 
		deepest within us; all aspects of our being are gathered together, 
		focusing intent. It is also a way of investing a form or an outward 
		gesture with spiritual power. When I light incense, I silently make this 
		prayer, or some variation on it: ‘May the fragrance of the truth 
		permeate all aspects of my being, activity of body, activity of speech, 
		activity of mind.’ When prayer is made with feeling and emotion, made 
		with intention, because body, speech and mind are all involved, there is 
		power in it. In that moment of offering something is done. I can’t say 
		precisely what this something is, but it is of relevance to the path. In 
		connecting consciously with that which one longs for, beyond the realm 
		of casual concerns, one’s life is given direction. Mindful prayer, 
		informed by wise contemplation, is a way of revealing our most treasured 
		aspirations and allowing them to guide the rest of our life. <br>
		<br>
		When I lived in Thailand, I noticed that there was something in common 
		between the Buddhist monks and the Christian missionaries in their use 
		of a particular word. The Thai Buddhists often discussed the importance 
		of making adhitthan, which is the Thai version of the Pali word 
		adhitthana. In Theravadin Buddhism, adhitthana means a conscious 
		determined intention to practise with effort and dedication. Thai 
		Christians used this very same word – adhitthan – when they talked about 
		prayer. <br>
		<br>
		My prayer life as a young person came with an understanding that there 
		was some almighty authority out there who was somehow responsible for 
		everything that happened, and that if you had a ticket you could get a 
		privileged relationship with this character, and he could do what you 
		wanted – if you asked nicely. The Thai Buddhists don’t have that idea at 
		all. That is not part of their conception of reality. After a few years 
		as a Buddhist monk I came to realise that, without having to believe I 
		was talking to an all-powerful figure who I had to obey and appease, I 
		was able to give voice to the heart’s wishes in a genuinely meaningful 
		way.<br>
		<br>
		The heart longs to speak and be heard. Some of you may be acquainted 
		with the bible where it says, in Psalm 130: ‘Out of the depths have I 
		called unto thee, oh Lord. Lord hear my voice: May Thine ears consider 
		well the voice of my complaint.’ I believe that the heart’s longing to 
		be heard is most naturally served by engaging in prayer. For those of us 
		who were brought up as theists and learned to pray in that context, but 
		later, feeling unfulfilled, withdrew from that form of religious 
		expression, it can be an uncomfortable and difficult prospect to begin 
		to pray again. Picking up a prayer life against the background of such 
		associations can bring serious reservations, even fear. I recall having 
		to deal with a strong fear that I might end up losing my faith as a 
		Buddhist and return to being a theist. As things turned out, that 
		testing was part of the process of finding my own way into a prayer life 
		again. <br>
		<br>
		By exercising careful mindfulness one can allow such fears without 
		necessarily believing in them. Just because we’re afraid something’s 
		going to happen doesn’t mean that it will happen. Just because you feel 
		guilty about something, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ve done 
		anything wrong; just because you want something doesn’t mean that you’ll 
		be happy when you get it. We’ve all seen how delusive apparent reality 
		can be. When I began to offer up my own prayers in a conscious way I had 
		to bear with my fears, but at the same time I was also aware of an 
		emerging sense of gratitude in being able to give voice to these deep 
		longings. Eventually the worries and doubts subsided and I found a 
		natural lightness and ease in what I was doing.<br>
		<br>
		One evening I was leading the community at Chithurst when a prayer group 
		from a local church came to visit. After I had given a talk I asked if 
		there were any questions. One of the group put up their hand and said, 
		“What good do you do for anybody else? You don’t even pray.” I replied 
		that I prayed every day. She responded, “Well, how can you pray when you 
		haven’t got a God?” What I found myself saying was, “The sun shines 
		whether or not it has anything to shine on.” The sun just shines, that 
		is its nature, and likewise it is the heart’s nature to speak and 
		express itself. It is not necessary to believe in an external ‘other’ 
		receiving us. <br>
		<br>
		This incident helped me to come to a clearer understanding of prayer 
		from the perspective of Buddhist practice. I came to see that in my 
		practice the orientation of attention was inward, whereas the person who 
		had asked the question was focused on the object of her supplications, 
		that is, a perceived Almighty. I wasn’t expecting intervention from 
		above in the way she was. When I pray it is for the sake of the heart 
		itself. The heart prays because it needs to if it wants to become free. 
		Our hearts are speaking all the time, but are we listening? We have deep 
		concerns, we have deep longings; with skilful attention we can enter 
		into a dialogue with this dimension of ourselves and in so doing be 
		enriched. The mysteriousness is welcoming and inviting. It is our own 
		true heart with which we are engaged. We don’t need to be afraid.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Insight Practice</i><br>
		<br>
		Insight (vipassana) meditation practice entails investigating all 
		phenomena according to their characteristics of impermanence, 
		unsatisfactoriness and not-self, with the aim of letting go of our 
		tendency to cling to them. If that is the totality of our practice, 
		however, we may try to let go of everything but still find that there’s 
		a cold dark contraction within that doesn’t want to let go.<br>
		<br>
		Equipping ourselves with mindfulness and non-judgemental here-and-now 
		awareness, it is possible to find our way into an intimate dialogue with 
		the dimension that theists might call ‘the divine principle’. For me the 
		divine principle is symbolised by the Triple Gem – the Buddha, the 
		Dhamma and the Sangha. In my own devotional practice I refer to it as 
		Lord Buddha, Lord Dhamma and Lord Sangha because I find the word ‘Lord’ 
		meaningful. To me the word ‘Lord’ carries the positive meaning of that 
		which rules over: the overriding governing principle. <br>
		<br>
		In traditional Buddhist countries nobody ever says, ‘Buddha said such 
		and such’. This would be to bring among common, ordinary things 
		something that is held in the highest possible esteem. Instead one 
		always says Lord Buddha, or, in Thai, Phra Buddha Jao. Phra Jao means a 
		Lord or God. Similarly, both the Dhamma and the Sangha are referred to 
		in Thailand as Lord Dhamma and Lord Sangha. This is not simply 
		child-like naïveté – this is to qualify these realities with words that 
		raise them up as worthy of veneration. Heart matters are more important 
		to us than casual concerns. If we don’t get to read the newspaper one 
		day, so what? We like to read the newspaper or drink coffee in the 
		morning, but we can do without gratifying these casual desires, which 
		are ultimately of trivial significance. But our heart’s longings – if 
		they go unattended to, there are serious consequences.<br>
		<br>
		There has been a general trend in our culture over the last few decades 
		towards a philosophy of relativism. The outlook of relativism is that 
		there is no objective good or bad – there are only personal preferences. 
		This is reflected in our day-to-day language: we have lost the usage of 
		words that once testified to the fact that we held certain things as 
		sacred and worthy of our deepest respect. In prayer – as a personal and 
		private matter – we have the opportunity to give expression to these 
		feelings that we all have in our hearts. It’s a conversation with a 
		higher principle – an intimate conversation. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Prayer and ‘merit’</i><br>
		<br>
		The Buddha made it very clear that if we make the right kind of effort 
		in the conduct of our body, speech and mind, we generate an active 
		potential that he referred to as puñña, which is rather ineloquently 
		translated into English as ‘merit’. Puñña is a living force of goodness. 
		In most schools of Buddhism it is a common practice to dedicate the 
		wholesome potential one has generated to particular individuals or to 
		all beings. We can think of this as either blessing or prayer.<br>
		<br>
		I appreciate how, for many, the concept of ‘merit’ smacks of materialism 
		and is off-putting. However, we can sometimes learn from a material 
		metaphor. For instance, in order to start a business we have to generate 
		potential to get it up and running. The potential in this case is 
		capital – we need to have accumulated sufficient savings of our own or 
		have secured a loan from a bank. This preparation is not the business 
		itself, because we are not yet doing what we have set out to do or 
		realising the result of the business that we want to run. Yet without 
		the potential that capital stands for, we can’t run the business – 
		that’s the reality. The same principle holds true spiritually.<br>
		<br>
		If out of unawareness we have come to a condition of selfishness, 
		isolation and loneliness and we wish to see our condition transformed, 
		we may wonder where the necessary force or energy will come from to 
		effect this transformation. Whether we are lay or monastic Buddhist 
		practitioners, a lot of our practice is concerned with generating the 
		accumulated momentum required for that transformation. This is one way 
		of understanding puñña. <br>
		<br>
		The act of dedicating puñña is aimed at purifying our effort. Despite 
		doing our best, without our noticing it, there can be a steadily 
		increasing sense of ourselves as being somehow spiritually superior to 
		other people. This sense of accumulated benefit can, if we are not 
		careful, increase our burden of conceit. When we dedicate any puñña that 
		we may have generated by wholesome conduct we are making the gesture of 
		giving it away. We pray, ‘may the goodness resulting from my practice 
		today, bring benefit to all beings’. When we do this, the focus of our 
		attention is on the heart itself; it is not outwardly directed, 
		concerned with what effect this gesture might have on the ‘world’. <br>
		<br>
		The Buddha told this story: There were two acrobats who travelled from 
		village to village, performing tricks as a way of earning a living. As 
		part of their act the older of the two would hold a ladder on his 
		shoulders while the younger scampered up and performed. They were 
		obviously aware that they needed to maintain close attention; otherwise 
		it could have been dangerous. One day the older one spoke saying that he 
		thought for the sake of keeping their act on the road the younger one 
		needed to pay closer attention to what he was doing down below on the 
		ground. He in turn would apply closer attention to what was going on at 
		the top of the ladder. The younger one respectfully listened, but then 
		said he felt it would be more effective if instead of watching each 
		other they paid closer attention to what each one was themselves doing. 
		That way, he said, there would be benefit. The Buddha’s comment on this 
		was that the younger one had it right. If we are each more careful about 
		what is ours to be responsible for, then we actually benefit each other.<br>
		<br>
		At the end of each day I find it wonderfully rewarding to dedicate the 
		merit of my practice. It is not my place to worry about whether by 
		making these wishes anyone else feels better. I am focused on doing what 
		I can to reduce the tendencies of greed, aversion and delusion in my own 
		heart. So I dwell on the thought, ‘May this act of dedication bring 
		benefit to my teachers – to Ajahn Tate, Ajahn Chah, and all those 
		teachers I’ve lived with; Ajahn Sumedho, without whom the monasteries in 
		Britain wouldn’t exist; the monks that I’ve lived with, my mother, my 
		father and the people that I care about, and those that I don’t 
		particularly care about; everybody who’s ever lived here at Ratanagiri, 
		who are living here now and will ever live here in the future.’ The 
		contents of the prayer can differ from day to day but the important 
		thing is generating a genuine sense of well-wishing or loving-kindness 
		to all people and all beings, without exception. I am not doing this 
		because it is ‘a part of our religion’. To make this gesture at the end 
		of the day lightens the burden of self-centredness. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Ancient Practices</i><br>
		<br>
		Our Asian teachers may not have explicitly taught the necessity of 
		cultivating an attitude of devotion, but they certainly demonstrated it 
		themselves. There are a number of instances I can remember when I saw 
		certain gestures that really cut right through any doubts or confusion I 
		may have had about the overall attitude I should be keeping in my 
		day-to-day practice. <br>
		<br>
		When I was a new monk and visiting Wat Pah Bahn Tard, which is the 
		monastery of Ajahn Mahaboowa – renowned as one of the most ferocious and 
		mighty masters of the present Theravada Buddhist Forest tradition – I 
		was waiting in the eating hall in the early morning, before we all went 
		out on alms round together, when the Venerable Ajahn came in. I expected 
		that he would probably start snapping orders to the monks, and then rush 
		off on pindapat – he had a reputation for being very gruff and very 
		fast. But what did he do? As he quietly entered the Hall, the first 
		thing he did was humbly kneel before the shrine and bow with the most 
		gracious prostrations that one would ever wish to see. I wondered, “Why 
		is he doing that? He’s supposed to be enlightened. I mean what is he 
		doing bowing to graven images?”<br>
		<br>
		This uninhibited expression of his devotion was a natural part of his 
		disposition. He had grown up with that sensibility, as Ajahn Chah, Ajahn 
		Tate and other eminent monks had. The same is true in Burma. At the 
		monasteries of the various well-known and Venerable Sayadaws, you will 
		see numerous well-kept shrines with monks, nuns and laity alike offering 
		respect by way of candles, flowers and incense. Before and after sitting 
		meditation they always mindfully bow three times in devotion to the 
		Buddha, their teacher to whom they know they owe so much. This is so 
		normal, so close to them that they just take it for granted. Addhithan, 
		making determinations, generating these conscious wishes from a deep 
		place within is thoroughly natural, and this, I feel, is one of the 
		essential nourishments of the contemplative life. Many followers of 
		vipassana teachings in the West that I have met report a lack of warmth, 
		joy, well-being and wholeness in their life. Perhaps their spiritual 
		diet lacks some important nutrients. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Silent prayer</i><br>
		<br>
		So I think prayer does have an important place in Theravada Buddhism. 
		This Way is about getting to know the nature of our own being, so that 
		we’re at one with our hearts and attentive to its truest longings. The 
		heart longs to return to its original condition of purity. To become 
		more conscious of that dimension of our heart is an important point of 
		practice. The reflections and ritual verses of contemplations that we 
		all recite together in the monastery are a safe place to start to pray. 
		Then, if we feel inclined, we can begin to say our own words. What does 
		your heart want to say? <br>
		<br>
		When we kneel before the shrine – that which symbolises perfect wisdom, 
		perfect compassion and perfect freedom for us – and we express our good 
		wishes for all beings – the bronze statue, beautiful and serene as it 
		is, is not listening to us. We are not asking the Buddha to grant us any 
		favours. Rather, beholding an image of the Buddha helps configure the 
		‘divine principle’ in our minds and creates the appropriate inner space 
		– a sacred place – in which we feel totally free to speak and in which 
		we can feel perfectly received. <br>
		<br>
		There is a touching passage in One Dharma by Joseph Goldstein. He refers 
		to an interview with Mother Theresa, in which the interviewer asks: <br>
		“When you pray what do you say to God?”<br>
		“I don’t say anything,” she said. “I just listen.” <br>
		“Well, what does God say to you?”<br>
		“God just listens.” <br>
		There was a pause in the interview, and she added, “…and if you don’t 
		understand that, I am afraid I can’t help you.”<br>
		<br>
		That’s the essence of it. We all have within us the faculty of 
		intuition, which, if we listen to it, can guide us towards our true 
		home, where we trust that unshakeable peace lies. Our hearts already 
		know the Way. Prayer and devotion put us in touch with the heart and its 
		natural wisdom, allowing it to gently lead us on that journey. <br>
		<br>
		Another question this evening asked: “Being here on retreat I’ve 
		remembered what I had forgotten about being present, and now I am afraid 
		that when I leave here I’m going to forget it again and become caught up 
		in all the many responsibilities and challenges. How can I effectively 
		remember this presence?” <br>
		<br>
		I think prayer is one way of remembering. If we wish, we can quietly, 
		reverently, offer up this prayer: ‘May the goodness of my practice 
		support me in my aspirations to be present in every moment of my day, no 
		matter what’s going on.’ Prayer helps.<br>
		<br>
		I am grateful for the questions you have asked this evening.</font></p>
