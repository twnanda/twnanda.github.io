		Just like birds that leave no tracks in the air,<br>
		there are those whose minds do not cling to temptations that are offered 
		to them.<br>
		Their focus is the signless state of liberation, which to others is 
		indiscernible.</i><br>
		<br>
		Dhammapada, verse 92<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		I’ve been asked to comment on the place of renunciation in our practice.<br>
		<br>
		Renunciation – nekkhamma in Pali – is one of what are known as the ten 
		paramitas, ‘perfections’ or ‘forces of goodness’. Personally, I feel 
		convinced that renunciation is one of the most important, and at the 
		same time least appreciated, aspects of spiritual life. I am not saying 
		this to justify my life as a monk. You might expect me to say that 
		renunciation is good, given that I’ve been doing it for twenty-five 
		years! Rather, I, along with many others, choose to live this life 
		because of the understanding that there is tremendous benefit in being 
		able to give up that which is extra – to be able to let go of that which 
		is not necessary and to live a simple life.<br>
		<br>
		Now, I am not merely talking about giving up outer physical things like, 
		for instance, eating in the evening. There is nothing moral or immoral 
		about not eating in the evening – you go without a glass of milk in the 
		evening, big deal! I don’t even mean the more difficult areas like music 
		and sex. These things that monks and nuns may give up are not in 
		themselves the real point of renunciation. These outer gestures of 
		renunciation are forms for encouraging an inner letting go. The gestures 
		in themselves are functional, aiding the cultivation of a strength of 
		heart that sustains us on an inner journey. And surely all of us, not 
		just monks and nuns, need this ability. It is true that the monastic 
		community chooses to emphasise this aspect of the Buddha’s teaching, 
		even make a lifestyle out of it, but the training is relevant for 
		everyone who is interested in inner freedom. <br>
		<br>
		Up until a few decades ago, the Roman Catholic Church used to require 
		that her followers refrain from eating meat on Fridays. When the Pope 
		lifted the prohibition I thought it was rather a pity. Although the 
		relevance of that particular form of abstinence was perhaps 
		questionable, at least it encouraged to some degree a formal practice of 
		giving up. I’m even old-fashioned enough to think that Lent is still a 
		good idea. It is a time of year that provides the opportunity to say, 
		‘Okay, for this period of time I’m going to put some energy into seeing 
		how able I am to give things up.’ <br>
		<br>
		The reality is that if we don’t know how to say ‘no’ to our conditioned 
		desires we are easily conned – by the outer world and by our inner 
		drives. If you can’t say ‘no’ to yourself when you go into one of these 
		supermarkets that have everything, you are likely to purchase more than 
		you intend. Leafing through exciting catalogues or shopping on the web, 
		you can be turning over your credit card details, acting out according 
		to the drama of the market place, and only afterwards start thinking, 
		‘What did I do that for?’ We’re all familiar with something like this – 
		the inability to say ‘no’ to things that are extra. <br>
		<br>
		We can recognise this on the external level: we buy new clothes that we 
		don’t need, food we don’t need or CDs that we might never listen to. But 
		what is more difficult to see is how this pattern pertains to our inner 
		world, to see the mental compulsion of perpetually adding onto 
		experience: good, bad; right, wrong; should, shouldn’t. This tendency to 
		react, judge and add on to our experience prevents us from being able to 
		receive reality in a pure, undiluted form. The point of living a life 
		where one renounces certain options is that by cultivating a conscious 
		willingness to say ‘no’ to things that we might otherwise want to have 
		or do – things that are not really necessary to our well-being – we use 
		outer conventions to learn how to let go at a deeper level. We learn the 
		art of letting go. We call this process of learning a ‘training’ because 
		it takes some skill in applying effort. Unskilled effort in this area 
		readily leads to blind and potentially damaging repression. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Picking up the training</i><br>
		<br>
		If we want to understand renunciation then we have to try it out. No 
		amount of talking about this practice takes us there. We only see what 
		it really achieves when we make an effort and observe the result. 
		Sometimes we are surprised at how good it feels to know we can say ‘no’ 
		to ourselves; it can even be intoxicatingly good. I recall translating 
		for a newly-ordained young monk who was full of the inspiration that can 
		come from having been recently been received into the renunciate Sangha. 
		He was asking Ajahn Chah for advice on how to apply the various methods 
		for cultivating renunciation and determination. This bright-eyed and 
		energetic fellow was telling Ajahn Chah how he wanted to make a 
		determination to spend the following three months of the rains retreat 
		observing the practices of not lying down to sleep, not accepting food 
		other than that gathered on almsround, eating only one meal a day, 
		wearing only the bare minimum of clothes, and so on. He listed lots of 
		the dhutanga (ascetic) practices that the Buddha encouraged. Ajahn Chah 
		listened and then commented that the best thing would be if he simply 
		determined to keep practising for the three months, whatever happened, 
		and take on nothing particularly special. Ajahn Chah was well aware of 
		how inspiring the renunciation practice can be when we first get a feel 
		for the power it generates. <br>
		<br>
		Sometimes we might even become a little evangelical about it – preaching 
		to everyone and anyone who will listen to us about the virtues of 
		renunciation, even enforcing it on others. This tends to be the aspect 
		that gives the whole subject a bad reputation. Some years ago Ajahn 
		Sumedho had to intervene to tone down the enthusiasm of a newly 
		appointed senior incumbent at a small branch monastery. This particular 
		monk had set up a system whereby all the food that had been prepared and 
		offered at the midday meal was poured into a big plastic bucket – rice, 
		curry, cakes, the lot. He would give it a stir, then take a few ladles 
		for himself before passing the bucket down the line. No doubt this 
		gesture of renunciation served to challenge preferences around food in a 
		worthy manner, but there was evidence that not everyone in the community 
		found it equally helpful. Ajahn Sumedho in his wisdom sent up a large 
		box of beautifully wrapped, delicious-looking biscuits with a note 
		saying, ‘Not for the bucket.’ <br>
		<br>
		Even without making any specific outer gesture of renunciation we can 
		learn from seeing how difficult it can be to let go of all that is extra 
		in our minds. An example is when we sit down to meditate for a period of 
		time. We know how the practice of concentration can steady the mind, 
		open the heart, and bring greater clarity and understanding – we know 
		how suitable and agreeable that state of mind is; and yet when we 
		decide, ‘Okay, I’ll put thirty minutes aside and sit in meditation,’ and 
		try to focus, the mind starts off every which way. We think, ‘Why is 
		that? Why is the mind going off? It’s not necessary, I have finished 
		with that stuff, I want to be quiet.’ This is what I mean by extra. So 
		can we let go of the extra? Do we have that ability, that strength that 
		enables simply saying ‘no’ to the force of compulsion?<br>
		<br>
		<i>Different from morality</i><br>
		<br>
		It has to be understood that we’re not talking about moral issues here. 
		Sometimes these two aspects of practice – morality and renunciation – 
		become mixed up, and that is not helpful. We’re not talking about the 
		five precepts that we all know about: no killing, no stealing, no 
		irresponsible sexuality, no false speech, and no intoxicants. These are 
		moral matters that, if we neglect them, cause harm to ourselves and harm 
		to others. When we take up eight precepts, the three more that are 
		adopted are precepts of renunciation. The sixth precept is refraining 
		from eating in the evening and the seventh and eighth precepts are about 
		giving up entertainment, distraction, music, jewellery, and sleeping 
		heedlessly. In addition, the third precept becomes a renunciant one, 
		changing abstention from irresponsible sexuality into celibacy (no 
		intentional sexual activity whatsoever). These are not issues of 
		morality. Traditionally lay Buddhists are encouraged to take up the 
		eight precepts for certain periods in order to cultivate this faculty of 
		renunciation, to release out of habits of holding to that which does not 
		pertain to the goal. This is addressing matters of skilfulness, not 
		morality.<br>
		<br>
		If you’re inspired by this possibility and want to try it out I would 
		encourage it but would suggest that you don’t tell anybody else that you 
		are doing it. Let it be a force for lessening the load rather than for 
		boosting a false sense of ego. You could decide for example that once a 
		week or once a month you’re going to exercise saying ‘no’ to something. 
		You might say ‘no’ to your wish to watch a particular program on 
		television – not for any moral reason but simply for the cultivation of 
		the ability to renounce without falling into inner argument or blind 
		repression. As a result of your experiment in renunciation you will 
		discover something interesting - you will get your energy back. You 
		will, guaranteed. If it doesn’t come the first time, say ‘no’ a few more 
		times. Initially this energy may manifest as anger or restlessness. When 
		you experience this agitation, you may decide that such practice is not 
		suitable for you. Or you may feel that you are beyond it, in which case 
		you won’t have any doubts whatsoever around energy and equanimity – you 
		will already be perfectly balanced. But if you are not quite there yet, 
		I would recommend persisting with it, sensitively and consistently, 
		learning from these initial reactions.<br>
		<br>
		Sometimes this practice can lead us to discover resources we didn’t 
		think we had. We might be surprised to find that we are able to hold 
		true to something, when in the past we might have caved in under 
		pressure. To take an example: I have a general mistrust of the mass 
		media and yet at the same time I can find their journalists and 
		programme producers extremely persuasive. The editors for television and 
		newspapers clearly send out their most charming interviewers in order to 
		secure the material, but what they eventually broadcast can be something 
		completely different to what was anticipated at the time the material 
		was gathered.<br>
		<br>
		Some years ago when I had been left in charge of the monastery at 
		Chithurst, some television people from Brighton were pressing for 
		permission to film a group of school children who were coming on a 
		Religious Education visit to the monastery. It wasn’t difficult to come 
		up with a justification for saying ‘yes’ to the programme producer, yet 
		my gut feeling was to mistrust their motivation, and to doubt whether 
		they would be sensitive enough to avoid distracting the children from 
		the purpose of their visit. So I said ‘no’. They called back many times 
		in an attempt to get me to change my mind but to my surprise I found it 
		quite easy to remain with my original answer. I confess I was somewhat 
		worried that the school might have been disappointed but still it felt 
		true to say ‘no’. As things turned out the head teacher got in touch to 
		say how delighted the school staff were because they hadn’t wanted the 
		television crew along on the trip either but nobody had ever said ‘no’ 
		to them before.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Strategic frustration</i><br>
		<br>
		If we feel unable in this area we can easily be distracted, inwardly and 
		outwardly. It is my observation that this not only makes us excessively 
		vulnerable but leads to dullness. If we let ourselves get what we want 
		all the time, we go flat, we lose the edge. In our present day culture 
		of affluence and comfort we are often disinclined to consider this 
		dynamic. The reality is that I like to get what I want and yet there is 
		a part of me that knows that complying with this arrangement fails to 
		give me the deeper contentment for which I long.<br>
		<br>
		I refer to this area of our practice as ‘strategic frustration’ – we set 
		out to engage frustration in a constructive way. The Rinzai school of 
		Zen Buddhism has formalised frustration into a meditation technique 
		called koan practice. The meditator is instructed to ponder on an 
		ultimately frustrating predicament or is given an apparently impossible 
		question that is specifically designed to ‘undo’ the thinking mind. In 
		this process tremendous energy is built up prior to the release that 
		comes with the ‘resolution’ of the koan. It is totally frustrating, and 
		is supposed to be that way. We can observe this process for ourselves. 
		Without attending a Zen retreat or becoming a celibate renunciate, 
		simply observe your energy level as you choose to either follow or 
		restrain your desires. Compulsively following desire dissipates so much 
		of our energy. <br>
		<br>
		What is the condition of the mind before wanting arises? It is actually 
		quite okay, isn’t it? The mind that is not disturbed by wanting anything 
		at all is peaceful. It is when wanting arises that we feel the itch, but 
		if we scratch the itch straightaway – gratifying the desire immediately 
		without stopping to investigate – we won’t notice how irritating desire 
		can be. When we are ruled by desire, we fail to see what it really is. 
		Desire is, in reality, simply a movement in consciousness – a wave upon 
		an ocean. However, that is not generally our experience; when desire 
		arises we are usually unsettled by it.<br>
		<br>
		After wanting has arisen three options are available to us. We can 
		gratify the wanting, which momentarily gets rid of it, such that the 
		relief from the irritation of desire may be perceived as pleasure. The 
		more often we follow this option, however, the more we increase the 
		momentum of wanting and gratifying. In the long run we tend to become 
		less peaceful. The next option available is to repress the desire and 
		pretend we do not want anything – which is to impose a blind judgement 
		on it. The third option is that we choose to hold this wanting in our 
		awareness. We can hold it. As a result of doing this, something 
		wonderful happens. The energy that is experienced as desire returns to 
		being raw energy. That energy can truly motivate practice and lead us to 
		a much greater happiness than that associated with the gratification of 
		sensual desires. So frustrating desire is not something for a few 
		weirdos or perverts who live in monasteries because they don’t know how 
		to enjoy life. Renunciation is a way of actually learning how to tap 
		into our deep inner well of energy. <br>
		<br>
		When people ask me about renunciation, I encourage them to investigate 
		for themselves and not merely accept unexamined opinions from others – 
		including me and my opinions. Try it out and see. If you’re struggling 
		inwardly with something that is difficult – like sadness, for example – 
		and you find it hard to let go, notice the characteristic of the 
		struggle. You feel that you want to let go but you can’t. You ask 
		yourself, ‘What is this holding on that I am doing? What is all this 
		extra baggage that I am carrying?’ A lot of it is just habit, just habit 
		that comes through not really taking the time to get to know desire as 
		it really is, as a movement in our minds. We too readily assume that we 
		must take sides for or against our desires without first inquiring into 
		their reality. Desire is not the way it appears to be. We can ask 
		ourselves, ‘Do I want to live according to the patterns of desire with 
		which I have become conditioned and limited? Or do I want to live in a 
		state of freedom by maintaining here-and-now judgment-free awareness?’ I 
		never cease to find this an inspiring contemplation. Renunciation, like 
		desire, is not what it might first seem. Skilfully going against our 
		desires is not going to make us less happy! <br>
		<br>
		Please don’t think that this practice is especially difficult or only 
		for a few individuals. We all need to know how to live consciously with 
		the authority to follow that which our heart tells us is true. We are 
		all potentially able to direct our attention towards what we personally 
		feel really matters. We do not, as it might appear, have to be 
		intimidated by other people’s persuasion. If in our own experience we 
		recognise something as worthy then let’s give ourselves to it 
		wholeheartedly and single-mindedly. Renunciation, developed with right 
		understanding, becomes the guiding principle that sustains us on our own 
		true path when we might otherwise have fallen into distraction.<br>
		<br>
		So thank you for your question this evening.</font></p>
