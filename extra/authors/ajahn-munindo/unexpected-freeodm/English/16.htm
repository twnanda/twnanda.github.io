		Happiness arises from the timely company of friends.<br>
		Happiness arises from having few needs.<br>
		Happiness arises from having accumulated virtue at life’s end.<br>
		Happiness arises from seeing beyond suffering.</i><br>
		<br>
		Dhammapada, verse .331<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		In the practice of the Buddha’s teaching we regularly hear about going 
		for Refuge. When we first encountered Buddhism some of us might have had 
		the impression that going for Refuge was an interesting traditional way 
		of talking about believing in a teacher. Perhaps it was part of the way 
		one became a member of the religion – you went through a ritual called 
		‘going for Refuge’.<br>
		<br>
		I know in my own case that it was not something I considered important 
		when I first discovered the Buddha’s teaching. I wanted to align myself 
		with a way of understanding the world that emphasised meditation. The 
		practice of going for refuge and precepts seemed rather secondary. It 
		took a good number of years before I began consciously to sense how 
		profoundly important it is to have a refuge; to have a sense of 
		something that one is committed to, something beyond getting what one 
		wants.<br>
		<br>
		Of course, we are all committed to getting what we want to some degree, 
		and there is a certain type of pleasure – a feeling of gratification – 
		to be derived from it. If I get what I want, I generally feel more 
		comfortable than if I don’t get what I want. In our effort to cultivate 
		awareness, however, our perception of this usual state of affairs 
		changes. We begin to understand that the pleasure of getting what we 
		want has a hook on it; it gradually becomes apparent that there is more 
		going on in the process of wanting and getting than we ordinarily 
		suppose. <br>
		<br>
		Assuming that you have to get what you want in order to be happy is very 
		limiting. If I’m addicted to getting what I want, I can’t help feeling 
		an embarrassing sense of dependency. The second line of verse 331 in the 
		Dhammapada reads ‘Happiness arises from having few needs.’ That is a 
		message one rarely hears – that there is a pleasure that comes from not 
		needing more than we already have. Usually we associate pleasure with 
		getting what we think we need or what we want, yet the Buddha wisely 
		pointed out that the very condition of clinging to wants and needs is 
		what stands in the way of a deeper happiness and contentment.<br>
		<br>
		This verse from the Dhammapada is about the nature of real pleasure. In 
		each line there is a reference to the Pali word sukha which means 
		‘happiness’ or ‘pleasure’. This verse provides a pertinent contemplation 
		for us to consider the way we seek happiness. We are all interested in 
		happiness – we all value well-being – but if we don’t stop and consider 
		carefully then we can easily settle for a happiness that falls far short 
		of what wise beings have realised is possible. <br>
		<br>
		The Buddha would sometimes use this word sukha when talking about 
		nibbana, for example, ‘nibbanam paramam sukham’. This is a line in a 
		stanza that we recite regularly, and it means ‘nibbana is ultimate 
		happiness’. People sometimes question this and say, ‘How can you use the 
		word ‘happiness’ when you talk about nibbana? Nibbana is supposed to be 
		about freedom from desire, and happiness is tied up with desire isn’t 
		it?’ Even a fully enlightened Buddha cannot say what nibbana is. It is 
		not possible to say what this state of enlightenment, liberation, or 
		total inner freedom that Buddhas have reached is like, because all words 
		and concepts about the experience are merely pointers to something 
		inconceivable and inexpressible. However, when asked what nibbana was 
		like, one of the ways the Buddha described it was as ultimate happiness. 
		What we want more than anything else is to experience this happiness is.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Valuing friendship</i><br>
		<br>
		A fully enlightened human being will tell you that it is not true that 
		happiness only arises when we get what we want. When happiness arises, 
		in whatever manner, we are encouraged to look at what it is that we are 
		experiencing and calling ‘happiness’, and how we relate to it. An 
		example is the happiness of the first line of that stanza – ‘Happiness 
		arises from the timely company of friends.’<br>
		<br>
		Over the last few weeks I have often reflected how fortunate our 
		community here is to have so many good friends, and how beneficial, how 
		truly wonderful it is to have such friends. This year we decided to have 
		a party. On the afternoon of Christmas Eve there was a children’s party, 
		and in the evening we had our own little party. We all sat round the 
		fire and, miraculously enough, good friends of the monastery turned up 
		with bottles of punch – non-alcoholic of course! So we spent the whole 
		evening together – just being together as a community. We weren’t 
		delving deep into the great mysteries of life, but were simply enjoying 
		each others’ company. There is a pleasure in being with people you feel 
		you can trust and a pleasure in being remembered by people that you have 
		shared something with. <br>
		<br>
		Unfortunately, we can sometimes take each other for granted. Even though 
		we care for and value each other, we perhaps don’t express it – we never 
		mention it to each other. Perhaps some of us have suffered the 
		consequences of this in relationships in which there hasn’t been enough 
		expression of appreciation of friendship. There is a skill in expressing 
		appreciation that we have to work to develop. The Buddha himself 
		recognised the danger of not valuing friendship, and spoke a lot about 
		the qualities and the value of friendship, the great blessing that is 
		true spiritual companionship. When we find it, we experience happiness, 
		and there is an encouragement to allow oneself to be fully conscious of 
		our appreciation; to feel nourished by good company. In the recent issue 
		of our monastery newsletter I let it be known how much we appreciate all 
		the Christmas Cards that we get here. I know that if people stopped 
		coming here on Sunday evenings or on New Year’s Eve and there was just 
		the nine of us, life wouldn’t be the same! Having friends come and join 
		us in a shared reaffirmation of things that we respect and value is 
		something we treasure.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Seeing deeper</i><br>
		<br>
		The second line of the verse says, ‘Happiness arises from having few 
		needs.’ It might be difficult to hear what is being said here if we 
		don’t engage ourselves in a meditation practice; if we haven’t 
		recognised for ourselves the possibility of inner quietness – a place 
		where we are not wanting anything in particular. Meditation provides the 
		means to observe that if there are ripples of wanting passing through 
		the mind we can see them just as they are – as ripples, movement. 
		There’s much more to us than what the active mind leads us to believe. 
		Sometimes we seem to be filled with a continuous stream of desire in our 
		minds and our hearts. Such activity is quite exhausting. If we don’t 
		choose to draw our attention inwards and enquire into the nature of this 
		active mind with its ideas and wantings then the way it appears to be is 
		who and what we feel ourselves to be. We believe, even feel convinced, 
		that the only way that we can be happy is by getting what we want. <br>
		<br>
		Some time ago I was told a story about a meditation student who lived in 
		London and had a busy working life. Unlike many who live in London, she 
		had consciously decided to walk to work every day. Over a period of time 
		she began to realise that she had developed a problem. As she walked to 
		work she would pass a particular French patisserie, and was unable to 
		walk past without buying not just one but several pastries. The process 
		of buying and eating these pastries stemmed from some inner compulsion 
		rather than from any natural desire to satisfy hunger. Over a period of 
		time she became aware what was going on and yet, although she recognised 
		it, she could not stop buying the pastries! This was a humiliating 
		experience for her, because in many areas of practice she was quite 
		able. But when she came to walking past this pastry shop it all fell 
		apart. One day, after acutely feeling the absurdity and oppressiveness 
		of the situation, she simply decided to walk to work by another route. 
		She made a resolution, a strong determination, that she would not walk 
		past the pastry shop. She made a gesture of renunciation. <br>
		<br>
		The student, feeling quite pleased about herself, reported all this to 
		her teacher, but the teacher said, “I’m afraid you’ve misunderstood the 
		teaching – that isn’t the spirit of the practice at all. The choice you 
		have made to walk another way is a strategy to avoid what is really 
		going on. What you need to do is walk to work as normal but prepare 
		yourself beforehand, both in the evening and the morning before you 
		begin your walk. As you take your walk follow the process step-by-step 
		and watch what is going on in your body and mind.”<br>
		<br>
		It is understood in our practice that disturbances of mind come to us 
		with differing degrees of intensity and that we need to respond 
		appropriately in each case. This particular phenomenon was of the sort 
		where what was called for was the need to prepare oneself beforehand. 
		What is necessary in such a situation is to slow down and to see what is 
		happening as it’s happening and just see it, just know it, not being 
		fooled by the way things appear to be, believing one won’t be happy 
		until one gets the pastry. <br>
		<br>
		This student was fooled regularly by the thought, ‘I will not be happy 
		until I get a pastry.’ So, following her teacher’s advice she prepared 
		herself beforehand. The next morning she walked to work as normal, 
		taking the route past the patisserie. She approached the shop remaining 
		fully aware of her feelings and thoughts. Soon she was outside, standing 
		there, fully conscious and knowing, ‘I want to go in and get a pastry.’ 
		It was quite clear she wasn’t kidding herself – she wasn’t trying to 
		convince herself that this was the case, she simply recognised with an 
		interested awareness that she wanted to go in and buy a pastry. As she 
		stood there it started to get a little easier to feel the wanting, until 
		she was just observing and knowing the raw energy of wanting. Soon 
		enough the wanting disappeared and she experienced a momentary ending of 
		suffering.<br>
		<br>
		Because of her patience and right effort this student had an insight 
		into the truth that this second line of the verse points to. Getting 
		more, in her case, was diminishing the quality of her life, although 
		those pastries looked as though they would add quality to her life! We 
		often believe that we need such things when we’re fooled by the way 
		desire appears. Desire has that apparent nature to it. There is nothing 
		wrong with this appearance as long as we recognise it.<br>
		<br>
		When desire arises there can appear to be some need. In relationships, 
		for example, the feeling can arise that there is something we really 
		need to tell the other person. It is not uncommon for someone to come to 
		see me to say, ‘I really need to tell you something.’ They get it off 
		their chest and feel better afterwards. I try to encourage people to 
		slow down; I ask them if they could try substituting ‘I really want to 
		tell you something.’ Then we can come to an agreement that if they want 
		to tell me something and I’m ready to hear it, we can enter into a 
		discussion. We have these ideas of what we need in all areas of our 
		life. There is an encouragement in our practice to investigate the 
		relationship we have with what we feel are our needs. <br>
		<br>
		So what this teaching points out is that, often enough, when we have 
		less we actually have more. This is not to judge apparent needs or 
		desires when they arise, but to generate an interest in looking deeper 
		at how we are as we are. For example, over the last ten years, on two or 
		three occasions, the feeling has arisen in me, ‘I need to get out of 
		here!’ Thankfully, I have had whatever it takes to not follow such 
		impulses. In fact I’m very grateful that I didn’t follow them because 
		behind the apparent need there is generally something else. We cultivate 
		in ourselves an interest in what is taking place when we have strongly 
		felt needs arising in order to see beyond the way things appear. This is 
		because there is something to be seen beyond the way things appear to 
		be: reality or Dhamma. The way things appear to be is ‘the world’. The 
		way things actually are is Dhamma. To see beyond the way things appear 
		to be is a source of great happiness and pleasure.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Practice as preparation</i><br>
		<br>
		The third line of this verse says, ‘Happiness arises from having 
		accumulated virtue at life’s end.’ That is something that would not 
		necessarily have occurred to me if I hadn’t read those words. It isn’t a 
		thought I would generally dwell on. But this is something the Buddha 
		spoke about often – not to waste our time, not to be heedless. We don’t 
		know when we’re going to die – it could be soon. He encouraged us to 
		prepare ourselves. A lot of what we are doing as spiritual practitioners 
		is, in fact, preparation. Ajahn Chah said that true practice is not 
		sitting on a cushion – that is preparation. The true practice happens 
		when the passions impact on the heart. If we can be there in the moment 
		of contact and stay there in the middle and not wobble, that is when we 
		are practising. But if we don’t prepare ourselves… Well, I’m sure you 
		all know from your own experiences what happens. <br>
		<br>
		Even if we prepare ourselves it is not easy, when the passions flare up, 
		to stay there in the midst of the fire. It is much easier to go with 
		them, to get carried away by them and act them out physically. The other 
		common response is to go up into the head and rationalise or fantasise 
		our way through their manifestation – perhaps in scenarios of heavenly 
		sensuality, or in theatres of horrendous violence: our fantasies can 
		take us to the most extraordinary limits. If we get carried away by the 
		passions, we act on them and do things without due care, driven by wild 
		energy. So our task is to be able to stay there in the centre, when the 
		energy is raging, without repressing, without pushing down so we get a 
		stomach disorder or a heart attack. We neither indulge in fantasies, nor 
		act out passion, but follow a middle way of being sensitive, yet still 
		and centred, when the passions are in full flight – this is the means by 
		which we can gradually undo our habitual patterns of avoidance.<br>
		<br>
		How is formal sitting preparation? When we sit on our cushion we are 
		encouraged to be still and not to move, even if we want to. As we sit we 
		just observe whatever is happening in body and mind without trying to 
		achieve anything special. We experience thoughts and fantasies and 
		different sorts of feelings and sensations. We allow things to be as 
		they are. The more we try to forcibly stop our imagination and internal 
		dialogue, the more vigorous our mental activity becomes. One skilful way 
		of working is to try seeing ourselves as being a host to visiting guests 
		– we treat them with kindness and courtesy and give them space to be 
		themselves. It is not our duty to get unnecessarily involved with them. 
		Sometimes our preoccupation with the momentum of our worldly activities 
		means that we do not attain any real peace. I have recently spent whole 
		meditation sessions designing the interior of our new retreat house! It 
		does not necessarily matter that we do not attain deep tranquillity. It 
		is more important to know that there is no obligation to be carried away 
		by our thoughts and reactions. The discipline of meditation is a way of 
		practising to be with reality as it is. This is what we are preparing 
		for – how to be with what is, fully present in body and mind, so that we 
		can learn from what is, instead of being caught up in ‘what if’ or ‘if 
		only’.<br>
		<br>
		The ‘what if’ disorder is endemic: ‘What if that didn’t happen?’ ‘What 
		if this happened?’ The ‘if only’ disease is also a very painful and sad 
		condition which we all suffer from to varying degrees. Instead of 
		suffering the agony of being caught up in the ‘if only’ disease we could 
		be experiencing the pleasure of learning from what already is – the way 
		things naturally are. This takes training, however, and one of the ways 
		the Buddha encouraged us to become more focused in our efforts is to 
		think about our death and what’s it going to be like. <br>
		<br>
		I have a very good friend who lives in a rest home in Newcastle. She was 
		independent until the age of ninety-seven, but in the past three years 
		has retired to a home where she receives nursing care. She was telling 
		me recently, “I really feel for the other people in this home. Most of 
		them haven’t prepared themselves for being here.” She sits in a room, 
		pretty much all day long, peacefully preparing for dying. Every time I 
		go to see her she says “I was preparing to die last night.” She 
		describes how on occasions she has woken around three in the morning 
		filled with a sense of awe associated with a perception of vast, free, 
		edgeless awareness. On starting to open her eyes, or on moving 
		physically, she observed a collapsing or a limiting of this awareness. 
		From this experience, she says, she has developed a practice of learning 
		how to inhibit this movement of contraction and to dissolve back into 
		edgelessness, which is how she imagines dying will be. We have often 
		talked about it in a calm and clear manner. She manifests a genuine 
		inner contentment. I could see that she felt real pity for the people 
		who distract themselves watching television all day long. She tends not 
		to get involved in the various activities that are arranged for people 
		living in the home. She feels that death is too important for her to be 
		distracting herself with such things. So most of the time she happily 
		stays in her room. She reads the Dhammapada and one or two other 
		Buddhist books. She meditates and contemplates dying. I find this a 
		great inspiration. When I read ‘Happiness arises from having accumulated 
		virtue by life’s end,’ I sometimes think what the alternative is – the 
		terrible sadness that arises when you realise your lot. The image the 
		Buddha gave for somebody who hasn’t spent their life developing virtue 
		is a scraggy old heron standing lonely at the edge of a dried up lake 
		without any fish in it. At the end of their life they haven’t 
		accumulated any virtue; all that remains is an inner sense of poverty. 
		Contrast that with the possibility of the real pleasure that can be 
		there if we come to the end our life knowing we’ve applied ourselves to 
		what really matters and is genuinely worthwhile.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Real refuge</i><br>
		<br>
		This brings us to the last line of this stanza: ‘Happiness arises from 
		seeing beyond suffering.’ To be able to see through suffering is to have 
		a refuge. To have such a refuge is like having a compass. If you are 
		ever out on the ocean or in the wilderness and you have a compass, you 
		can find your bearings. In that sense a compass is very valuable. That’s 
		what I understand by refuge. It means skilfully enquiring into life and 
		finding out what is really worthy. In the Pali language the word for an 
		enlightened being is arahant, which literally means one who is worthy. 
		Such a person is worthy because they have understood what is truly 
		worthwhile from the perspective of reality. In the practice of the 
		Buddha-Dhamma one is gradually finding out what is really valuable in 
		life, and thus one gains a true orientation. This orientation is 
		synonymous with taking refuge in the Buddha. <br>
		<br>
		And remember what ‘Buddha’ means. There is the historical Buddha, of 
		course, the human being who lived in India two and a half thousand years 
		ago. For his humanity, teaching and example we are humbly grateful. But 
		it wasn’t his person that he left behind. The reality of the Buddha here 
		and now in which we can go for refuge is a quality of mind that has the 
		integrity and wisdom to see through the appearance of suffering, not by 
		ignoring it, but by looking ever more fully and bravely at the reality 
		of it. The Buddha said, ‘If you want to see the Buddha, see the Dhamma.’ 
		See the reality, see actuality. To come to see reality clearly, just as 
		it is, is to realise that it is the most valuable refuge that we could 
		have.<br>
		<br>
		To take Refuge in the Buddha is to cultivate the potential that we all 
		have for living out of an awareness that isn’t limited by our reactions 
		to our experience. The historical Buddha was certainly a human being. He 
		sat and he ate; he walked and he bathed himself just as a normal person 
		does. He suffered the experience of ageing and would sit in the morning 
		sun to find relief from pains in his back. What was different about him 
		was that his awareness wasn’t limited. We, on the other hand, experience 
		limitations of awareness all the time. A clear example of this is when 
		we come up against the reaction of, ‘I can’t take it any more.’ Now, 
		whenever we experience this reaction, if we have developed awareness, 
		there is a part of us that knows that this feeling of being limited is 
		not the ultimate truth. We have all at times endured past the experience 
		of ‘I can’t take it any more’ and found that we can take it. Perhaps we 
		have been on retreat and begun to experience an excruciating pain; or 
		perhaps some fear or other emotion arose, and we felt unable to bear it. 
		Instead of simply giving up, inspired by faith we have been able to 
		breathe through these experiences, remaining focused on their reality, 
		and what we have discovered is that the pain dissolves or we experience 
		a release from the overwhelming emotion. We realise that the apparent 
		reality of ‘I can’t take it any more’ was just that – an appearance, an 
		apparition; it was the apparent reality. If we had been completely 
		fooled by the world, or by the way things appear to be, we would have 
		grasped at that apparent reality, believing it to be the real state of 
		things. Then we would have fixed that imposed limitation on awareness 
		and defined ourselves as just that, thereby suffering the consequences 
		of feeling inherently limited.<br>
		<br>
		There are many other examples in our lives where we feel, ‘I must have…’ 
		or ‘I cannot put up with that.’ The promise, the hope and the 
		inspiration that is offered us in the example of the Buddha and all his 
		enlightened disciples is the message that undefiled awareness is not 
		limited. It is inherently limitless. Appamano Buddho, appamano Dhammo, 
		appamano Sangha – ‘Limitless is the Buddha, limitless is the Truth, 
		limitless is the Sangha.’ <br>
		<br>
		Consider for yourself the possibility through your own investigation 
		that, when you feel limited, that is how it appears to be. Just consider 
		that – don’t simply believe it – then witness the experience of the 
		heart and mind expanding, and the resulting potential for living 
		increase, with more room, more possibility. If you learn something from 
		that, consider what happens if you keep going until there aren’t any 
		limitations any more, as you have let go completely. To quote Ajahn Chah 
		again, ‘If you let go a little you have a little peace, if you let go a 
		lot you have a lot of peace, if you let go completely you have complete 
		peace.’<br>
		<br>
		We take these three jewels as our refuge: the Buddha, the Dhamma and the 
		Sangha. We consciously contemplate our true refuge and hold it up as of 
		supreme value. Suffering is inevitable when we impose limitations on our 
		hearts and minds. The Buddha was free from suffering because he had 
		freed himself from all such habits. For us there is suffering – 
		appropriately, accordingly. For us there is freedom only in small 
		moments. <br>
		<br>
		When we learn to experience suffering so that we don’t believe in the 
		way it appears to be, and we endure in the way that we need to endure – 
		with here-and-now judgement-free awareness – sooner or later we will 
		experience a letting-go, bringing relief and joy. This is the happiness 
		that comes from seeing through suffering and this is the happiness that 
		strengthens our faith. Faith that is discovered like this doesn’t get us 
		into arguments or lead to contention. This is a personally verified form 
		of faith and is what can give us bearings in life. Even though at times 
		we might find ourselves without light or any outer signs that we are 
		heading in the right direction, we can feel secure in an inner sense of 
		trusting that comes from our heart’s orientation towards truth.<br>
