<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This discourse is an interesting example of the folklore of the Pali Canon. It shows that the tendency of Asian popular Buddhism to regard the Buddha as a protective figure, and not just as a teacher, has its roots in the earliest part of the tradition. Metrical analysis indicates that the long “tribute” section of this discourse is very old, while the verses in the introductory section—which is also found in the Saṁyutta Nikāya—are later. This fits with a more subjective judgment: that the tribute was an earlier composition, to which the introduction was added at a later date. This judgment is based on the fact that the two sections do not quite fit each other. The introduction to the tribute indicates that the reciter of the tribute is the Buddha himself, whereas the narration in the tribute indicates otherwise. The style of the tribute—with its repeated stanzas and tropes—also falls into the ancient genre of verses celebrating a king’s victory over his enemies.</p>
<p>At any rate, this discourse is the closest thing in the Pali Canon to a “who’s who” of the deva worlds, and should provide useful material for anyone interested in the cosmology of early Buddhism.</p>
<p>The Commentary reports the belief that devas still enjoy hearing this discourse chanted in Pali. Until recently it was part of many monks’ standard memorized repertoire, to be chanted at weddings and the dedication of new buildings. Even today, as many of the traditions of memorization in Asia seem to be falling by the wayside, there are a few monks and laypeople who chant this discourse regularly.</p>

<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Forest, together with a large Saṅgha of approximately five hundred monks, all of them arahants. And most of the devatās from ten world-systems had gathered in order to see the Blessed One &amp; the Saṅgha of monks.</p>
<p>Then the thought occurred to four devatās of the ranks from the Pure Abodes: “The Blessed One is dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Forest, together with a large Saṅgha of about five hundred monks, all of them arahants. And most of the devatās from ten world-systems have gathered in order to see the Blessed One &amp; the Saṅgha of monks. Let us also approach the Blessed One and, on arrival, let us each speak a verse in his presence.”</p>
<p>Then, just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, those devatās disappeared from among the Devas of the Pure Abodes and reappeared before the Blessed One. Having paid homage to him, they stood to one side. As they were standing there, one devatā recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“A great meeting in the woods:</div>
<div class="line">The deva hosts have assembled.</div>
<div class="line">We have come to this Dhamma meeting</div>
<div class="line">to see the unvanquished Saṅgha.”</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Then another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">“There the monks are concentrated,</div>
<div class="line">have straightened their own minds.</div>
<div class="line">Like a charioteer holding the reins,</div>
<div class="line">the wise ones guard their faculties.”</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Then another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">“Having cut through barrenness, cut the cross-bar,</div>
<div class="line">having uprooted Indra’s pillar, unstirred,</div>
<div class="line">they wander about pure, unstained,</div>
<div class="line">young nāgas <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a> well tamed by the One with Eyes.”</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Then another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">“Those who have gone to the Buddha for refuge</div>
<div class="line">will not go to the plane of woe.</div>
<div class="line">On discarding the human body,</div>
<div class="line">they will fill the hosts of the devas.”</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: &quot;Monks, most of the devatas from ten world-systems have gathered in order to see the Tathagata and the Bhikkhu Sangha. Those who, in the past, were Pure Ones, Rightly Self-awakened, at most had their devata-gathering like mine at the present. Those who, in the future, will be Pure Ones, Rightly Self-awakened, will at most have their devata-gathering like mine at the present. I will detail for you the names of the deva hosts. I will describe to you the names of the deva hosts. I will teach you the names of the deva hosts. Listen and pay close attention. I will speak.&quot;</p>
<p>“As you say, lord,” the monks responded to the Blessed One.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I recite a verse of tribute.</div>
<div class="line">Those who live where spirits dwell,</div>
<div class="line">who live in mountain caves,</div>
<div class="line">resolute, concentrated,</div>
<div class="line">many, like hidden lions,</div>
<div class="line">who have overcome horripilation,</div>
<div class="line">white-hearted, pure,</div>
<div class="line">serene, and undisturbed:</div>
<div class="line">Knowing that more than 500 of them</div>
<div class="line">had come to the forest of Kapilavatthu,</div>
<div class="line">the Teacher then said to them,</div>
<div class="line">disciples delighting in his instruction,</div>
<div class="line">&quot;The deva hosts have approached.</div>
<div class="line">Detect them, monks!&quot;</div>
<div class="line">Listening to the Awakened One's instruction,</div>
<div class="line">they made an ardent effort.</div>
<div class="line">Knowledge appeared to them,</div>
<div class="line">vision of non-human beings.</div>
<div class="line">Some saw 100, some 1,000, some 70,000,</div>
<div class="line">some had vision of 100,000 non-human beings.</div>
<div class="line">Some gained vision of innumerable devas</div>
<div class="line">filling every direction.</div>
<div class="line">Realizing all this,</div>
<div class="line">the One-with-Vision felt moved to speak.</div>
<div class="line">The Teacher then said to them,</div>
<div class="line">disciples delighting in his instruction,</div>

<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/DN/DN01.html">DN 1</a> reports that devas corrupted by play and corrupted by mind, on falling to the human state and then remembering their previous lives, hold views of partial eternalism. Their accounts of why they hold these views incidentally show what “corrupted by play” and “corrupted by mind” mean:</li>
</ol>
<p>“Those honorable devas who are not corrupted by play don’t spend an excessive amount of time indulging in the delights of laughter &amp; play. Because they don’t spend an excessive amount of time indulging in the delights of laughter &amp; play, their mindfulness doesn’t become muddled. Because of unmuddled mindfulness, they don’t fall from that company. They are constant, permanent, eternal, not subject to change, and will stay just like that as long as eternity. But those of us who were corrupted by play spent an excessive amount of time indulging in the delights of laughter &amp; play. Because we spent an excessive amount of time indulging in the delights of laughter &amp; play, our mindfulness became muddled. Because of muddled mindfulness, we fell from that company and—inconstant, impermanent, short-lived, subject to falling—have come to this world.’” — <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/DN/DN01.html">DN 1</a></p>
<p class="last">“Those honorable devas who are not corrupted in mind don’t spend an excessive amount of time staring at one another. Because they don’t spend an excessive amount of time staring at one another, their minds don’t become corrupted toward one another. Because they are uncorrupted in mind toward one another, they don’t grow exhausted in body or exhausted in mind. They don’t fall from that company. They are constant, permanent, eternal, not subject to change, and will stay just like that as long as eternity. But those of us who were corrupted in mind spent an excessive amount of time staring at one another. Because we spent an excessive amount of time staring at one another, our minds became corrupted toward one another. Because we were corrupted in mind toward one another, we grew exhausted in body &amp; exhausted in mind.

<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/DN/DN01.html">DN 1</a>  tells how the Great Brahmā appears spontaneously at the beginning of an eon, and how he and his retinue become deluded about his creative powers:</li>
</ol>
<p>“There ultimately comes a time when, with the passing of a long stretch of time, this world devolves. When the world is devolving, beings for the most part head toward the Radiant (Brahmās). There they stay: mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, coursing through the air, established in beauty for a long stretch of time. Then there ultimately comes a time when, with the passing of a long stretch of time, this world evolves. When the world is evolving, an empty Brahmā palace appears. Then a certain being—from the exhaustion of his life span or the exhaustion of his merit—falls from the company of the Radiant and re-arises in the empty Brahmā palace. And there he still stays mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, coursing through the air, established in beauty for a long stretch of time.</p>
<p>“After dwelling there alone for a long time, he experiences displeasure &amp; agitation: ‘O, if only other beings would come to this world!’</p>
<p>“Then other beings, through the ending of their life span or the ending of their merit, fall from the company of the Radiant and reappear in the Brahmā palace, in the company of that being. And there they still stay mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, coursing through the air, established in beauty for a long stretch of time.</p>
<p class="last">“Then the thought occurred to the being who reappeared first: ‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. These beings were created by me. Why is that? First the thought occurred to me, “O, if only other beings would come to this world!” And thus my direction of will brought these beings to this world.’ As for the beings who reappear later, this thought occurred to them: ‘This is Brahmā… Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. We were created by this Brahmā. Why is that? We saw that he appeared here before, while we appeared after.’ The being who reappeared first was of longer life span, more beautiful, &amp; more influential, while the beings who reappeared later were of shorter life span, less beautiful, &amp; less influential.” — <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/DN/DN01.html">DN 1</a></p>

      <p>巴利文經典最突出的特點，同時也是缺乏同情心的讀者最感厭倦的特點，就是單字、語句和整段文節的重複。這一部分是文法或至少是文體所產生的結果。 …，…，…，</p>
      <p>…，…，…， 這種文句冗長的特性，另外還有一個原因，那就是在長時期中三藏經典只以口授相傳。 …，…，…，</p>
      <p>…，…，…， 巴利文經典令人生厭的機械性的重覆敘述，也可能一部分是由於僧伽羅人(Sinhalese)不願遺失外國傳教師傳授給他們的聖語 …，…，…，</p>
      <p>…，…，…， 重覆敘述不僅是說教記錄的特點，而且也是說教本身的特點。我們持有的版本，無疑地是把一段自由說教壓縮成為編有號碼的段落和重覆敘述的產品。佛陀所說的話一定比這些生硬的表格更為活潑柔軟得多。</p>
