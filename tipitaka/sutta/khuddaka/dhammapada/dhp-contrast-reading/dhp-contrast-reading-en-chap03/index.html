<pre class="last literal-block">
Quivering, wavering,
hard to guard,
to hold in check:
  the mind.
The sage makes it straight —
like a fletcher,
the shaft of an arrow.

Like a fish
pulled from its home in the water
&amp; thrown on land:
this mind flips &amp; flaps about
  to escape Mara's sway.

Hard to hold down,
  nimble,
alighting wherever it likes:
  the mind.
Its taming is good.
The mind well-tamed
  brings ease.

So hard to see,
so very, very subtle,
alighting wherever it likes:
  the mind.
The wise should guard it.
The mind protected
  brings ease.

Wandering far,
going alone,
bodiless,
lying in a cave:
  the mind.
Those who restrain it:
  from Mara's bonds
  they'll be freed.

The traditional interpretation of the term is &quot;that which is aware of an object&quot; (cinteti = vijānāti). Actually it is not that which thinks of an object as the term implies. If it could be said &quot;it thinks&quot; as one says in English &quot;it rains&quot;, it would be more in consonance with the Buddha's teaching. From an ultimate standpoint citta may be defined as the awareness of an object, since Buddhism denies a subjective agent like a soul.

It is clear that the Buddha has not definitely assigned a specific basis for consciousness as He had done with the other senses. It was the cardiac theory (the theory that the heart is the seat of consciousness) that prevailed in His time, and this was evidently supported by the Upanishads. The Buddha could have adopted this popular theory, but He did not commit Himself. In the Paññhāna, the Book of Relations, the Buddha refers to the basis of consciousness in such indirect terms as yaṃ rūpaṃ nissāya, dependent on that material thing. What the material thing was the Buddha did not positively assert. According to the views of commentators like the Venerables Buddhaghosa and Anuruddha the seat of consciousness is the heart (hadayavatthu).</p>

She saw, that they all had potential for arahantship, but they needed proper food. So she gave them alms food and soon they all became arahants.</p>
<p>At the end of the retreat they went back to the Buddha and reported what happened. A certain monk decided to go to the same village.

He further instructed them to recite the poem from the outskirts of the forest and enter the monastery still reciting. The monks did accordingly.</p>
