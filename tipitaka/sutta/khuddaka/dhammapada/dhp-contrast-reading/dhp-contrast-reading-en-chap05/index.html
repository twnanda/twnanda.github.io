He felt a strong desire to offer the flowers to the Buddha. He decided that even if the king were to fire him or even kill him, he would offer the flowers to the Buddha. He did so and was filled with delightful satisfaction.</p>

The news of her beauty traveled very far and she had many suitors from near and afar. Amongst them was her cousin Nanda who fell in love with her hopelessly. But she decided not to marry any of them and became a nun instead. One day after lightening a lamp she kept her mind fixed on the flame as her object of meditation and she attained arahantship.</p>
<p>Later she moved to the forest and lived in solitude. Once Nanda came to her hut when she was not there and hid under the couch. He was determined to take her by force if she did not agree to marry him. Uppalavaṇṇā returned and he jumped up. She tried to warn him, told him that he would have to bear consequences for his actions, but he did not listen and raped her. For this he indeed had to suffer a long period of time.</p>
<p class="last">When the Buddha heard about this, he told King Pasenadi of Kosala about the dangers that nuns living by themselves in the forest had to face. The king built a monastery within the city and from that time on the nuns lived only in the city.</p>

His name was Jambuka. He had very strange habits. He would sleep only on the floor and eat his own excrements. When he grew up, his parents sent him to the ascetics. But even those ascetics felt his habits were too disgusting so they sent him away. After that he lived alone in the forest. During the day he would stay on one leg (as he said, he was to heavy for the earth to bear him) and with his mouth open (he boasted that he lived only on air). He also used to say that he never sits down and never sleeps. But at night he slept on the floor and ate his own excrements.</p>
<p>Many people started to count themselves as his followers; they would bring him food and gifts. But he did not take anything, only sometimes he would take a little bit of food and eat it with the tip of the kusa grass, which was quite common practice for ascetics. Thus he lived many years.</p>
<p>Once the Buddha came to where he was staying and asked for a place to spend the night. Jambuka let him sleep in the nearby cave. At night, many gods and supernatural beings came to pay homage to the Buddha. Jambuka saw this and asked the Buddha what happened.</p>
<p>When the Buddha told him that these beings were gods, Jambuka was impressed. He told the Buddha that he must be a very holy person, because although he himself spent years standing on one leg and eating only air, no god ever came to pay homage to him. The Buddha told him that he could not be fooled. He said that he knew very well that Jambuka slept on the ground every night and ate his excrements.</p>
<p>The Buddha also explained, that during one of his previous existences Jambuka had prevented a certain monk to go obtain alms food and how he threw away the food that was sent with him for that very monk. As a result of these actions he was born with these strange habits.</p>
<p>Jambuka realized his mistakes and paid respects to the Buddha. The Buddha delivered a discourse, at the end of which Jambuka attained arahantship and became one of the Buddha's monks.</p>
<p class="last">When Jambuka's followers arrived they were surprised to see their teacher with the Buddha. Jambuka announced that he was now a member of Buddha's Sangha, the Order and a disciple of the Buddha. The Buddha explained that the cruelest austerities practiced for a long period of time are not worth even one-sixteenth of understanding of the true Dharma.</p>

The Buddha then said that he himself saw that very peta on the day he attained awakenment. In one of his previous existences it was a rich landowner. There lived an Individual Buddha (Paccekabuddha) close to one of his fields. People who went to pay their respects to this Buddha had to pass through his field. He feared that this would damage the field and so he set fire to it. So the Buddha had to move to some other place. Because of this evil deed he was reborn as a peta-ghost.</p>

His teacher warned him not to hit cows or people - he would have to pay compensations to the owner of the cow or the relatives of that person.</p>

<p>On day, Venerable Moggallāna and Venerable Sāriputta came to the monastery. They gave a discourse and after hearing it, Citta attained the third stage of Awakenment.

<p>But the next day Sudhamma came to the Citta's house nevertheless. He was invited inside, but he refused, saying that he was on his alms round.

<p>Sudhamma then reported to the Buddha what happened. The Buddha told him, &quot;You have offended a faithful and generous lay disciple.

Sudhamma went back to the Buddha, who admonished him with this verse (and the following one, see DhP 74). He said, &quot;You should not be attached to this or that dwelling, to this or that lay disciple - in this way the pride and envy will increase.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Venerable Sāriputta, Moggallāna, and other senior monks paid visit to Tissa. Villagers requested Sāriputta to deliver a discourse, but he let speak Tissa instead. Villagers were not pleased, because they never heard anything from Tissa except for the words &quot;May you be well and happy!&quot; They thought he did not really understand Dharma.</p>
<p>But Tissa gave a discourse and spoke for the whole night. Villagers were impressed and felt lucky that they have such a wise monk with them. But still they were a bit angry with him for not speaking earlier.</p>
